<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>This work treats of the fish from all the varied points of
view of the different branches of the study of Ichthyology. In
general all traits of the fish are discussed, those which the fish
shares with other animals most briefly, those which relate to
the evolution of the group and the divergence of its various
classes and orders most fully. The extinct forms are restored
to their place in the series and discussed along with those still
extant.</p>

<p>In general, the writer has drawn on his own experience as an
ichthyologist, and with this on all the literature of the science.
Special obligations are recognized in the text. To Dr. Charles
H. Gilbert, he is indebted for a critical reading of most of his
proof-sheets; to Dr. Bashford Dean, for criticism of the proof-sheets
of the chapters on the lower fishes; to Dr. William Emerson
Ritter, for assistance in the chapters on <i>Protochordata</i>; to
Dr. George Clinton Price, for revision of the chapters on lancelets
and lampreys, and to Mr. George Clark, Secretary of Stanford
University, for assistance of various kinds, notably in the preparation
of the index. To Dr. Theodore Gill, he has been for
many years constantly indebted for illuminating suggestions, and
to Dr. Barton Warren Evermann, for a variety of favors. To
Dr. Richard Rathbun, the writer owes the privilege of using
illustrations from the "Fishes of North and Middle America"
by Jordan and Evermann. The remaining plates were drawn
for this work by Mary H. Wellman, Kako Morita, and Sekko
Shimada. Many of the plates are original. Those copied from
other authors are so indicated in the text.</p>

<p>No bibliography has been included in this work. A list of
writers so complete as to have value to the student would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
a volume of itself. The principal works and their authors are
discussed in the chapter on the History of Ichthyology, and
with this for the present the reader must be contented.</p>

<p>The writer has hoped to make a book valuable to technical
students, interesting to anglers and nature lovers, and instructive
to all who open its pages.</p>

THE LIFE OF THE FISH</h2>

<p class="center">A POPULAR ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF THE LONG-EARED
SUNFISH, <i>LEPOMIS MEGALOTIS</i>
</p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_003.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><b><span class="smcap">What</span> is a Fish?</b>&mdash;A fish is a back-boned animal which
lives in the water and cannot ever live very long
anywhere else. Its ancestors have always dwelt in
water, and most likely its descendents will forever follow their
example. So, as the water is a region very different from the
fields or the woods, a fish in form and structure must be quite
unlike all the beasts and birds that walk or creep or fly above
ground, breathing air and being fitted to live in it. There are
a great many kinds of animals called fishes, but in this all of
them agree: all have some sort of a back-bone, all of them
breathe their life long by means of gills, and none have fingers
or toes with which to creep about on land.</p>

<p><b>The Long-eared Sunfish.</b>&mdash;If we would understand a fish,
we must first go and catch one. This is not very hard to do, for
there are plenty of them in the little rushing brook or among the
lilies of the pond. Let us take a small hook, put on it an angleworm
or a grasshopper,&mdash;no need to seek an elaborate artificial
fly,&mdash;and we will go out to the old "swimming-hole" or the deep
eddy at the root of the old stump where the stream has gnawed
away the bank in changing its course. Here we will find
fishes, and one of them will take the bait very soon. In one
part of the country the first fish that bites will be different from
the first one taken in some other. But as we are fishing in
the United States, we will locate our brook in the centre of population
of our country. This will be to the northwest of Cincin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>nati,
among the low wooded hills from which clear brooks flow
over gravelly bottoms toward the Ohio River. Here we will catch
sunfishes of certain species, or maybe rock bass or catfish: any
of these will do for our purpose. But one of our sunfishes is
especially beautiful&mdash;mottled blue and golden and scarlet, with
a long, black, ear-like appendage backward from his gill-covers&mdash;and
this one we will keep and hold for our first lesson in fishes.
It is a small fish, not longer than your hand most likely, but it
can take the bait as savagely as the best, swimming away with
it with such force that you might think from the vigor of its
pull that you have a pickerel or a bass. But when it comes out
of the water you see a little, flapping, unhappy, living plate of
brown and blue and orange, with fins wide-spread and eyes
red with rage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

Bloomington, Indiana.) Family <i>Centrarchid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Form of the Fish.</b>&mdash;And now we have put the fish into a
bucket of water, where it lies close to the bottom. Then we take
it home and place it in an aquarium, and for the first time we
have a chance to see what it is like. We see that its body is
almost elliptical in outline, but with flat sides and shaped on the
lower parts very much like a boat. This form we see is such as
to enable it to part the water as it swims. We notice that its
progress comes through the sculling motion of its broad, flat tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Face of a Fish.</b>&mdash;When we look at the sunfish from the front
we see that it has a sort of face, not unlike that of higher animals.
The big eyes, one on each side, stand out without eyelids, but the
fish can move them at will, so that once in a while he seems to
wink. There isn't much of a nose between the eyes, but the
mouth is very evident, and the fish opens and shuts it as
it breathes. We soon see that it breathes water, taking it in
through the mouth and letting it flow over the gills, and then
out through the opening behind the gill-covers.</p>

<p><b>How the Fish Breathes.</b>&mdash;If we take another fish&mdash;for we shall
not kill this one&mdash;we shall see that in its throat, behind the mouth-cavity,
there are four rib-like bones on each side, above the
beginning of the gullet. These are the gill-arches, and on each
one of them there is a pair of rows of red fringes called the gills.
Into each of these fringes runs a blood-vessel. As the water
passes over it the oxygen it contains is absorbed through the
skin of the gill-fringe into the blood, which thus becomes purified.
In the same manner the impurities of the blood pass out
into the water, and go out through the gill-openings behind.
The fish needs to breathe just as we do, though the apparatus of
breathing is not the same. Just as the air becomes loaded with
impurities when many people breathe it, so does the water in our
jar or aquarium become foul if it is breathed over and over again
by fishes. When a fish finds the water bad he comes to the surface
to gulp air, but his gills are not well fitted to use undissolved
air as a substitute for that contained in water. The rush of a
stream through the air purifies the water, and so again does the
growth of water plants, for these in the sunshine absorb and
break up carbonic acid gas, and throw out oxygen into the water.</p>

<p><b>Teeth of the Fish.</b>&mdash;On the inner side of the gill-arch we
find some little projections which serve as strainers to the water.
These are called gill-rakers. In our sunfish they are short and
thick, seeming not to amount to much but in a herring they are
very long and numerous.</p>

<p>Behind the gills, at the opening of the gullet, are some roundish
bones armed with short, thick teeth. These are called pharyngeals.
They form a sort of jaws in the throat, and they are useful
in helping the little fish to crack shells. If we look at the mouth
of our live fish, we shall find that when it breathes or bites it moves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the lower jaw very much as a dog does. But it can move the
upper jaw, too, a little, and that by pushing it out in a queer
fashion, as though it were thrust out of a sheath and then drawn
in. If we look at our dead fish, we shall see that the upper jaw
divides in the middle and has two bones on each side. On one
bone are rows of little teeth, while the other bone that lies behind
it has no teeth at all. The lower jaw has little teeth like those
of the upper jaw, and there is a patch of teeth on the roof of the
mouth also. In some sunfishes there are three little patches,
the vomer in the middle and the palatines on either side.</p>

<p>The tongue of the fish is flat and gristly. It cannot move it,
scarce even taste its food with it, nor can it use it for making a
noise. The unruly member of a fish is not its tongue, but its tail.</p>

<p><b>How the Fish Sees.</b>&mdash;To come back to the fish's eye again.
We say that it has no eyelids, and so, if it ever goes to sleep, it
must keep its eyes wide open. The iris is brown or red. The pupil
is round, and if we could cut open the eye we should see that the
crystalline lens is almost a perfect sphere, much more convex than
the lens in land animals. We shall learn that this is necessary
for the fish to see under water. It takes a very convex lens or
even one perfectly round to form images from rays of light
passing through the water, because the lens is but little more
dense than the water itself. This makes the fish near-sighted.
He cannot see clearly anything out of water or at a distance.
Thus he has learned that when, in water or out, he sees anything
moving quickly it is probably something dangerous, and the
thing for him to do is to swim away and hide as swiftly as
possible.</p>

<p>In front of the eye are the nostrils, on each side a pair of
openings. But they lead not into tubes, but into a little cup
lined with delicate pink tissues and the branching nerves of
smell. The organ of smell in nearly all fishes is a closed sac,
and the fish does not use the nostrils at all in breathing. But
they can indicate the presence of anything in the water which is
good to eat, and eating is about the only thing a fish cares for.</p>

<p><b>Color of the Fish.</b>&mdash;Behind the eye there are several bones on the
side of the head which are more or less distinct from the skull
itself. These are called membrane bones because they are
formed of membrane which has become bony by the deposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
in it of salts of lime. One of these is called the opercle, or
gill-cover, and before it, forming a right angle, is the preopercle,
or false gill-cover. On our sunfish we see that the
opercle ends behind in a long and narrow flap, which looks
like an ear. This is black in color, with an edging of scarlet
as though a drop of blood had spread along its margin.
When the fish is in the water its back is dark greenish-looking,
like the weeds and the sticks in the bottom, so that we cannot
see it very plainly. This is the way the fish looks to the fishhawks
or herons in the air above it who may come to the stream
to look for fish. Those fishes which from above look most like
the bottom can most readily hide and save themselves. The
under side of the sunfish is paler, and most fishes have the belly
white. Fishes with white bellies swim high in the water, and the
fishes who would catch them lie below. To the fish in the water
all outside the water looks white, and so the white-bellied fishes
are hard for other fishes to see, just as it is hard for us to see a
white rabbit bounding over the snow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_007.jpg" width="600" height="454" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Common sunfish, <i>Eupomotis gibbosus</i> (Linn&aelig;us). Natural size. (From
life by R. W. Shufeldt.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>But to be known of his own kind is good for the sunfish, and
we may imagine that the black ear-flap with its scarlet edge
helps his mate and friends to find him out, where they swim on
his own level near the bottom. Such marks are called recognition-marks,
and a great many fishes have them, but we have no
certain knowledge as to their actual purpose.</p>

<p>We are sure that the ear-flap is not an ear, however. No
fishes have any external ear, all their hearing apparatus being
buried in the skull. They cannot hear very much: possibly a
great jar or splash in the water may reach them, but whenever
they hear any noise they swim off to a hiding-place, for any disturbance
whatever in the water must arouse a fish's anxiety.
The color of the live sunfish is very brilliant. Its body is covered
with scales, hard and firm, making a close coat of mail,
overlapping one another like shingles on a roof. Over these is a
thin skin in which are set little globules of bright-colored matter,
green, brown, and black, with dashes of scarlet, blue, and white
as well. These give the fish its varied colors. Some coloring
matter is under the scales also, and this especially makes the
back darker than the lower parts. The bright colors of the sunfish
change with its surroundings or with its feelings. When it
lies in wait under a dark log its colors are very dark. When it
rests above the white sands it is very pale. When it is guarding
its nest from some meddling perch its red shades flash out as it
stands with fins spread, as though a water knight with lance at
rest, looking its fiercest at the intruder.</p>

<p>When the sunfish is taken out of the water its colors seem to
fade. In the aquarium it is generally paler, but it will sometimes
brighten up when another of its own species is placed beside it.
A cause of this may lie in the nervous control of the muscles
at the base of the scales. When the scales lie very flat the color has
one appearance. When they rise a little the shade of color seems
to change. If you let fall some ink-drops between two panes of
glass, then spread them apart or press them together, you will
see changes in the color and size of the spots. Of this nature is
the apparent change in the colors of fishes under different conditions.
Where the fish feels at its best the colors are the richest.
There are some fishes, too, in which the male grows very brilliant
in the breeding season through the deposition of red, white, black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
or blue pigments, or coloring matter, on its scales or on its head
or fins, this pigment being absorbed when the mating season is
over. This is not true of the sunfish, who remains just about
the same at all seasons. The male and female are colored
alike and are not to be distinguished without dissection. If we
examine the scales, we shall find that these are marked with fine
lines and concentric stri&aelig;, and part of the apparent color is due
to the effect of the fine lines on the light. This gives the bluish
lustre or sheen which we can see in certain lights, although we
shall find no real blue pigment under it. The inner edge of each
scale is usually scalloped or crinkled, and the outer margin of
most of them has little prickly points which make the fish seem
rough when we pass our hand along his sides.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_009.jpg" width="700" height="191" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;<i>Ozorthe dictyogramma</i> (Herzenstein). A Japanese blenny, from Hakodate:
showing increased number of lateral lines, a trait characteristic of many fishes of
the north Pacific.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Lateral Line.</b>&mdash;Along the side of the fish is a line of
peculiar scales which runs from the head to the tail. This is
called the lateral line. If we examine it carefully, we shall see
that each scale has a tube from which exudes a watery or
mucous fluid. Behind these tubes are nerves, and although not
much is known of the function of the tubes, we can be sure that
in some degree the lateral line is a sense-organ, perhaps aiding
the fish to feel sound-waves or other disturbances in the water.</p>

<p><b>The Fins of the Fish.</b>&mdash;The fish moves itself and directs its
course in the water by means of its fins. These are made up of
stiff or flexible rods growing out from the body and joined together
by membrane. There are two kinds of these rays or rods
in the fins. One sort is without joints or branches, tapering to
a sharp point. The rays thus fashioned are called spines, and
they are in the sunfish stiff and sharp-pointed. The others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
known as soft rays, are made up of many little joints, and most
of them branch and spread out brush-like at their tips. In the
fin on the back the first ten of the rays are spines, the rest are
soft rays. In the fin under the tail there are three spines, and in
each fin at the breast there is one spine with five soft rays. In
the other fins all the rays are soft.</p>

<p>The fin on the back is called the dorsal fin, the fin at the end
of the tail is the caudal fin, the fin just in front of this on the
lower side is the anal fin. The fins, one on each side, just behind
the gill-openings are called the pectoral fins. These correspond
to the arms of man, the wings of birds, or the fore legs of a turtle
or lizard. Below these, corresponding to the hind legs, is the
pair of fins known as the ventral fins. If we examine the bones
behind the gill-openings to which the pectoral fins are attached,
we shall find that they correspond after a fashion to the shoulder-girdle
of higher animals. But the shoulder-bone in the sunfish
is joined to the back part of the skull, so that the fish has
not any neck at all. In animals with necks the bones at the
shoulder are placed at some distance behind the skull.</p>

<p>If we examine the legs of a fish, the ventral fins, we shall
find that, as in man, these are fastened to a bone inside called
the pelvis. But the pelvis in the sunfish is small and it is placed
far forward, so that it is joined to the tip of the "collar-bone" of
the shoulder-girdle and pelvis attached together. The caudal
fin gives most of the motion of a fish. The other fins are mostly
used in maintaining equilibrium and direction. The pectoral
fins are almost constantly in motion, and they may sometimes
help in breathing by starting currents outside which draw water
over the gills.</p>

<p><b>The Skeleton of the Fish.</b>&mdash;The skeleton of the fish, like that
of man, is made up of the skull, the back-bone, the limbs, and
their appendages. But in the fish the bones are relatively
smaller, more numerous, and not so firm. The front end of the
vertebral column is modified as a skull to contain the little
brain which serves for all a fish's activities. To the skull are
attached the jaws, the membrane bones, and the shoulder-girdle.
The back-bone itself in the sunfish is made of about
twenty-four pieces, or vertebr&aelig;. Each of these has a rounded
central part, concave in front and behind. Above this is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
channel through which the great spinal cord passes, and above
and below are a certain number of processes or projecting
points. To some of these, through the medium of another set of
sharp bones, the fins of the back are attached. Along the sides
of the body are the slender ribs.</p>

<p><b>The Fish in Action.</b>&mdash;The fish is, like any other animal, a
machine to convert food into power. It devours other animals
or plants, assimilates their substance, takes it over into itself,
and through its movements uses up this substance again. The
food of the sunfish is made up of worms, insects, and little fishes.
To seize these it uses its mouth and teeth. To digest them it
needs its alimentary canal, made of the stomach with its glands
and intestines. If we cut the fish open, we shall find the stomach
with its pyloric c&aelig;ca, near it the large liver with its gall-bladder,
and on the other side the smaller spleen. After the
food is dissolved in the stomach and intestines the nutritious
part is taken up by the walls of the alimentary canal, whence
it passes into the blood.</p>

<p>The blood is made pure in the gills, as we have already seen.
To send it to the gills the fish has need of a little pumping-engine,
and this we shall find at work in the fish as in all higher animals.
This engine of stout muscle surrounding a cavity is called the
heart. In most fishes it is close behind the gills. It contains
one auricle and one ventricle only, not two of each as in man.
The auricle receives the impure blood from all parts of the body.
It passes it on to the ventricle, which, being thick-walled, is
dark red in color. This passes the blood by convulsive action,
or heart-beating, on to the gills. From these the blood is collected
in arteries, and without again returning to the heart it
flows all through the body. The blood in the fish flows sluggishly.
The combustion of waste material goes on slowly, and
so the blood is not made hot as it is in the higher beasts and
birds. Fishes have relatively little blood; what there is is
rather pale and cold and has no swift current.</p>

<p>If we look about in the inside of a fish, we shall find close
along the lower side of the back-bone, covering the great artery,
the dark red kidneys. These strain out from the blood a certain
class of impurities, poisons made from nerve or muscle
waste which cannot be burned away by the oxygen of respiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Air-bladder.</b>&mdash;In the front part of the sunfish, just above
the stomach, is a closed sac, filled with air. This is called the
air-bladder, or swim-bladder. It helps the fish to maintain its
place in the water. In bottom fishes it is almost always small,
while fishes that rise and fall in the current generally have a
large swim-bladder. The gas inside it is secreted from the
blood, for the sunfish has no way of getting any air into it from
the outside.</p>

<p>But the primal purpose of the air-bladder was not to serve
as a float. In very old-fashioned fishes it has a tube connecting
it with the throat, and instead of being an empty sac it is a true
lung made up of many lobes and parts and lined with little blood-vessels.
Such fishes as the garpike and the bowfin have lung-like
air-bladders and gulp air from the surface of the water.</p>

<p>In the very little sunfish, when he is just hatched, the air-bladder
has an air-duct, which, however, is soon lost, leaving
only a closed sac. From all this we know that the air-bladder
is the remains of what was once a lung, or additional arrangement
for breathing. As the gills furnish oxygen enough, the
lung of the common fish has fallen into disuse and thrifty Nature
has used the parts and the space for another and a very different
purpose. This will serve to help us to understand the swim-bladder
and the way the fish came to acquire it as a substitute
for a lung.</p>

<p><b>The Brain of the Fish.</b>&mdash;The movements of the fish, like those
of every other complex animal, are directed by a central nervous
system, of which the principal part is in the head and is
known as the brain. From the eye of the fish a large nerve
goes to the brain to report what is in sight. Other nerves go
from the nostrils, the ears, the skin, and every part which has
any sort of capacity for feeling. These nerves carry their messages
inward, and when they reach the brain they may be transformed
into movement. The brain sends back messages to the
muscles, directing them to contract. Their contraction moves
the fins, and the fish is shoved along through the water. To
scare the fish or to attract it to its food or to its mate is about
the whole range of the effect that sight or touch has on the
animal. These sensations changed into movement constitute
what is called reflex action, performance without thinking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
what is being done. With a boy, many familiar actions may be
equally reflex. The boy can also do many other things "of his
own accord," that is, by conscious effort. He can choose among
a great many possible actions. But a fish cannot. If he is
scared, he must swim away, and he has no way to stop himself.
If he is hungry, and most fishes are so all the time, he will spring
at the bait. If he is thirsty, he will gasp, and there is nothing
else for him to do. In other words, the activities of a fish are
nearly all reflex, most of them being suggested and immediately
directed by the influence of external things. Because its
actions are all reflex the brain is very small, very primitive, and
very simple, nothing more being needed for automatic movement.
Small as the fish's skull-cavity is, the brain does not
half fill it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The vacant space about the little brain is filled with a fatty
fluid mass looking like white of egg, intended for its protection.
Taking the dead sunfish (for the live one we shall look after
carefully, giving him every day fresh water and a fresh worm
or snail or bit of beef), if we cut off the upper part of the skull
we shall see the separate parts of the brain, most of them lying
in pairs, side by side, in the bottom of the brain-cavity. The
largest pair is near the middle of the length of the brain, two
nerve-masses (or ganglia), each one round and hollow. If we
turn these over, we shall see that the nerves of the eye run into
them. We know then that these nerve-masses receive the
impressions of sight, and so they are called optic lobes. In
front of the optic lobes are two smaller and more oblong nerve-masses.
These constitute the cerebrum. This is the thinking
part of the brain, and in man and in the higher animals it makes
up the greater part of it, overlapping and hiding the other ganglia.
But the fish has not much need for thinking and its fore-brain
or cerebrum is very small. In front of these are two small,
slim projections, one going to each nostril. These are the olfactory
lobes which receive the sensation of smell. Behind the
optic lobes is a single small lobe, not divided into two. This
is the cerebellum and it has charge of certain powers of motion.
Under the cerebellum is the medulla, below which the spinal
cord begins. The rest of the spinal cord is threaded through
the different vertebr&aelig; back to the tail, and at each joint it sends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
out nerves of motion and receives nerves of sense. Everything
that is done by the fish, inside or outside, receives the attention
of the little branches of the great nerve-cord.</p>

<p><b>The Fish's Nest.</b>&mdash;The sunfish in the spawning time will
build some sort of a nest of stones on the bottom of the eddy,
and then, when the eggs are laid, the male with flashing eye and
fins all spread will defend the place with a good deal of spirit.
All this we call instinct. He fights as well the first time as
the last. The pressure of the eggs suggests nest-building to
the female. The presence of the eggs tells the male to defend
them. But the facts of the nest-building and nest protection are
not very well understood, and any boy who can watch them and
describe them truly will be able to add something to science.</p>

THE EXTERIOR OF THE FISH</h2>

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_016.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Form</span> of Body.</b>&mdash;With a glance at the fish as a living
organism and some knowledge of those structures
which are to be readily seen without dissection, we
are prepared to examine its anatomy in detail, and to note some
of the variations which may be seen in different parts of the
great group.</p>

<p>In general fishes are boat-shaped, adapted for swift progress
through the water. They are longer than broad or deep and
the greatest width is in front of the middle, leaving the compressed
paddle-like tail as the chief organ of locomotion.</p>

</div>

<p>But to all these statements there are numerous exceptions.
Some fishes depend for protection, not on swiftness, but on the
thorny skin or a bony coat of mail. Some of these are almost
globular in form, and their outline bears no resemblance to that
of a boat. The trunkfish (<i>Ostracion</i>) in a hard bony box has
no need of rapid progress.</p>

inch of the fish's length.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The pine-cone fish (<i>Monocentris japonicus</i>) adds strong fin-spines
to its bony box, and the porcupine fish (<i>Diodon hystrix</i>)
is covered with long prickles which keep away all enemies.</p>

<p>Among swift fishes, there are some in which the body is
much deeper than long, as in <i>Antigonia</i>. Certain sluggish fishes
seem to be all head and tail, looking as though the body by
some accident had been omitted. These, like the headfish
(<i>Mola mola</i>) are protected by a leathery skin. Other fishes, as
the eels, are extremely long and slender, and some carry this
elongation to great extremes. Usually the head is in a line
with the axis of the body, but in some cases, as the sea-horse
(<i>Hippocampus</i>), the head is placed at right angles to the axis,
and the body itself is curved and cannot be straightened without
injury. The type of the swiftest fish is seen among the
mackerels and tunnies, where every outline is such that a racing
yacht might copy it.</p>

<p>The body or head of the fish is said to be compressed when
it is flattened sidewise, depressed when it is flattened vertically.
Thus the <i>Peprilus</i> (Fig. 10) is said to be compressed, while the
fishing-frog (<i>Lophius</i>) (Fig. 11) has a depressed body and head.
Other terms as truncate (cut off short), attenuate (long-drawn
out), robust, cuboid, filiform, and the like may be needed in
descriptions.</p>

<p><b>Measurement of the Fish.</b>&mdash;As most fishes grow as long as
they live, the actual length of a specimen has not much value
for purposes of description. The essential point is not actual
length, but relative length. The usual standard of measurement
is the length from the tip of the snout to the base of the
caudal fin. With this length the greatest depth of the body,
the greatest length of the head, and the length of individual parts
may be compared. Thus in the Rock Hind (<i>Epinephelus
adscensionis</i>), fig. 12, the head is contained 2-3/5 times in the
length, while the greatest depth is contained three times.</p>

<p>Thus, again, the length of the muzzle, the diameter of the eye,
and other dimensions may be compared with the length of the
head. In the Rock Hind, fig. 12, the eye is 5 in head, the snout
is 4-2/5 in head, and the maxillary 2-3/5. Young fishes have the
eye larger, the body slenderer, and the head larger in proportion
than old fishes of the same kind. The mouth grows larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
with age, and is sometimes larger also in the male sex. The
development of the fins often varies a good deal in some fishes
with age, old fishes and male fishes having higher fins when
such differences exist. These variations are soon understood by
the student of fishes and cause little doubt or confusion in the
study of fishes.</p>

(Osbeck). Family <i>Serranid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Scales, or Exoskeleton.</b>&mdash;The surface of the fish may be
naked as in the catfish, or it may be covered with scales, prickles,
shagreen, or bony plates. The hard covering of the skin, when
present, is known as the exoskeleton, or outer skeleton. In the
fish, the exoskeleton, whatever form it may assume, may be
held to consist of modified scales, and this is usually obviously
the case. The skin of the fish may be thick or thin, bony,
horny, leathery, or papery, or it may have almost any intermediate
character. When protected by scales the skin is usually
thin and tender; when unprotected it may be ossified, as in the
sea-horse; horny, as in the headfish; leathery, as in the catfish;
or it may, as in the sea-snails, form a loose scarf readily detachable
from the muscles below.</p>

<p>The scales themselves may be broadly classified as ctenoid,
cycloid, placoid, ganoid, or prickly.</p>

<p><i>Ctenoid and Cycloid Scales.</i>&mdash;Normally formed scales are
rounded in outline, marked by fine concentric rings, and crossed
on the inner side by a few strong radiating ridges and folds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
They usually cover the body more or less evenly and are imbricated
like shingles on a roof, the free edge being turned backward.
Such normal scales are of two types, ctenoid or cycloid.
Ctenoid scales have a comb-edge of fine prickles or cilia; cycloid
scales have the edges smooth. These two types are not very
different, and the one readily passes into the other, both being
sometimes seen on different parts of the same fish. In general,
however, the more primitive representatives of the typical fishes,
those with abdominal ventrals and without spines in the fins,
have cycloid or smooth scales. Examples are the salmon,
herring, minnow, and carp. Some of the more specialized
spiny-rayed fishes, as the parrot-fishes, have, however, scales
equally smooth, although somewhat different in structure.
Sometimes, as in the eel, the cycloid scales may be reduced to
mere rudiments buried in the skin.</p>

<p><i>Ctenoid</i> scales are beset on the free edge by little prickles or
points, sometimes rising to the rank of spines, at other times
soft and scarcely noticeable, when they are known as ciliate or
eyelash-like. Such scales are possessed in general by the more
specialized types of bony fishes, as the perch and bass, those
with thoracic ventrals and spines in the fins.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Scales of
<i>Acanthoessus bronni</i>
(Agassiz). (After
Dean.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Placoid Scales.</i>&mdash;Placoid scales are ossified papill&aelig;, minute,
enamelled, and close-set, forming a fine shagreen. These are
characteristic of the sharks; and in the
most primitive sharks the teeth are evidently
modifications of these primitive structures.
Some other fishes have scales which appear
shagreen-like to sight and feeling, but only
the sharks have the peculiar structure to
which Agassiz gave the name of placoid.
The rough prickles of the filefishes and
some sculpins are not placoid, but are reduced
or modified ctenoid scales, scales narrowed
and reduced to prickles.</p>

<p><i>Bony and Prickly Scales.</i>&mdash;Bony and prickly scales are
found in great variety, and scarcely admit of description or
classification. In general, prickly points on the skin are modifications
of ctenoid scales. Ganoid scales are thickened and covered
with bony enamel, much like that seen in teeth, otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
essentially like cycloid scales. These are found in the garpike
and in many genera of extinct Ganoid and Crossopterygian
fishes. In the line of descent the placoid scale preceded the
ganoid, which in turn was followed by the
cycloid and lastly by the ctenoid scale. Bony
scales in other types of fishes may have nothing
structurally in common with ganoid scales
or plates, however great may be the superficial
resemblance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 542px;">
<img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="542" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;Cycloid
Scale.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The distribution of scales on the body may
vary exceedingly. In some fishes the scales
are arranged in very regular series; in others
they are variously scattered over the body.
Some are scaly everywhere on head, body, and fins. Others
may have only a few lines or patches. The scales may be
everywhere alike, or they may in one part or another be greatly
modified. Sometimes they are transformed into feelers or tactile
organs. The number of scales is always one of the most valuable
of the characters by which to distinguish species.</p>

<p><b>Lateral Line.</b>&mdash;The lateral line in most fishes consists of a
series of modified scales, each one provided with a mucous tube
extending along the side of the body from the head to the caudal
fin. The canal which pierces each scale is simple at its base, but
its free edge is often branched or ramified. In most spiny-rayed
fishes it runs parallel with the outline of the back. In most
soft-rayed fishes it follows rather the outline of the belly. It is
subject to many variations. In some large groups (<i>Gobiid&aelig;</i>,
<i>P&aelig;ciliid&aelig;</i>) its surface structures are entirely wanting. In scaleless
fishes the mucous tube lies in the skin itself. In some
groups the lateral line has a peculiar position, as in the flying-fishes,
where it forms a raised ridge bounding the belly. In
many cases the lateral line has branches of one sort or another.
It is often double or triple, and in some cases the whole back
and sides of the fish are covered with lateral lines and their
ramifications. Sometimes peculiar sense-organs and occasionally
eye-like luminous spots are developed in connection with the
lateral line, enabling the fish to see in the black depths of the
sea. These will be noticed in another chapter.</p>

<p><i>The Lateral Line as a Mucous Channel.</i>&mdash;The more primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
condition of the lateral line is seen in the sharks and chim&aelig;ras,
in which fishes it appears as a series of channels in or under
the skin. These channels are filled with mucus, which exudes
through occasional open pores. In many fishes the bones
of the skull are cavernous, that is, provided with cavities filled
with mucus. Analogous to these cavities are the mucous channels
which in primitive fishes constitute the lateral line.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;Singing Fish (with many lateral lines), <i>Porichthys porosissimus</i> (Cuv.
and Val.). Gulf of Mexico.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Function of the Lateral Line.</i>&mdash;The general function of the
lateral line with its tubes and pores is still little understood.
As the structures of the lateral line are well provided with
nerves, it has been thought to be an organ of sense of some
sort not yet understood. Its close relation to the ear is beyond
question, the ear-sac being an outgrowth from it.</p>

<p>"The original significance of the lateral line," according to
Dr. Dean,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "as yet remains undetermined. It appears intimately
if not genetically related to the sense-organs of the head
and gill region of the ancestral fish. In response to special
aquatic needs, it may thence have extended farther and farther
backward along the median line of the trunk, and in its later
differentiation acquired its metameral characters." In view
of its peculiar nerve-supply, "the precise function of this entire
system of organs becomes especially difficult to determine.
Feeling, in its broadest sense, has safely been admitted as its
possible use. Its close genetic relationship to the hearing
organ suggests the kindred function of determining waves of
vibration. These are transmitted in so favorable a way in
the aquatic medium that from the side of theory a system of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>hypersensitive end-organs may well have been established.
The sensory tracts along the sides of the body are certainly
well situated to determine the direction of the approach of
friend, enemy, or prey."</p>

<p><b>The Fins of Fishes.</b>&mdash;The organs of locomotion in the fishes
are knows as fins. These are composed of bony or cartilaginous
rods or rays connected by membranes. The fins are divided
into two groups, paired fins and vertical fins. The pectoral fins,
one on either side, correspond to the anterior limbs of the higher
vertebrates. The ventral fins below or behind them represent
the hinder limbs. Either or both pairs may be absent, but
the ventrals are much more frequently abortive than the pectorals.
The insertion of the ventral fins may be abdominal, as
in the sharks and the more generalized of the bony fishes, thoracic
under the breast (the pelvis attached to the shoulder-girdle) or
jugular, under the throat. When the ventral fins are abdominal,
the pectoral fins are usually placed very low. The
paired fins are not in general used for progression in the water,
but serve rather to enable the fish to keep its equilibrium.
With the rays, however, the wing-like pectoral fins form the
chief organ of locomotion.</p>

<p>The fin on the median line of the back is called the dorsal,
that on the tail the caudal, and that on the lower median line
the anal fin. The dorsal is often divided into two fins or even
three. The anal is sometimes divided, and either dorsal or
anal fin may have behind it detached single rays called finlets.</p>

<p>The rays composing the fin may be either simple or branched.
The branched rays are always articulated, that is, crossed by
numerous fine joints which render them flexible. Simple rays
are also sometimes articulate. Rays thus jointed are known
as soft rays, while those rays which are neither jointed nor
branched are called spines. A spine is usually stiff and sharp-pointed,
but it may be neither, and some spines are very slender
and flexible, the lack of branches or joints being the
feature which distinguishes spine from soft ray.</p>

<p>The anterior rays of the dorsal and anal fins are spinous in
most fishes with thoracic ventrals. The dorsal fin has usually
about ten spines, the anal three, but as to this there is
much variation in different groups. When the dorsal is di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>vided
all the rays of the first dorsal and usually the first ray of
the second are spines. The caudal fin has never true spines,
though at the base of its lobes are often rudimentary rays
which resemble spines. Most spineless fishes have such rudiments
in front of their vertical fins. The pectoral, as a rule,
is without spines, although in the catfishes and some others a
single large spine may be developed. The ventrals when abdominal
are usually without spines. When thoracic each
usually, but not always, consists of one spine and five soft
rays. When jugular the number of soft rays may be reduced,
this being a phase of degeneration of the fin. In writing descriptions
of fishes the number of spines may be indicated by
Roman numerals, those of the soft rays by Arabic. Thus
D. XII-I, 17 means that the dorsal is divided, that the anterior
portion consists of twelve spines, the posterior of one
spine and seventeen soft rays. In some fishes, as the catfish or
the salmon, there is a small fin on the back behind the dorsal
fin. This is known as the adipose fin, being formed of fatty
substance covered by skin. In a few catfishes, this adipose fin
develops a spine or soft rays.</p>

<p><b>Muscles.</b>&mdash;The movements of the fins are accomplished by
the muscles. These organs lie along the sides of the body,
forming the flesh of the fish. They are little specialized, and
not clearly differentiated as in the higher vertebrates.</p>

<p>With the higher fishes there are several distinct systems of
muscles controlling the jaws, the gills, the eye, the different
fins, and the body itself. The largest of all is the great lateral
muscle, composed of flake-like segments (myocommas) which
correspond in general with the number of the vertebr&aelig;. In
general the muscles of the fish are white in color. In some
groups, especially of the mackerel family, they are deep red,
charged with animal oils. In the salmon they are orange-red,
a color also due to the presence of certain oils.</p>

<p>In a few fishes muscular structures are modified into electric
organs. These will be discussed in a later chapter.</p>

THE DISSECTION OF THE FISH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_026.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Blue-green Sunfish.</b>&mdash;The organs found in the
abdominal cavity of the fish may be readily traced
in a rapid dissection. Any of the bony fishes may
be chosen, but for our purposes the sunfish will serve
as well as any. The names and location of the principal
organs are shown in the accompanying figure, from Kellogg's
Zoology. It represents the blue-green sunfish, <i>Apomotis cyanellus</i>,
from the Kansas River, but in these regards all the
species of sunfishes are alike. We may first glance at the different
organs as shown in the sequence of dissection, leaving a
detailed account of each to the subsequent pages.</p>

<p><b>The Viscera.</b>&mdash;Opening the body cavity of the fish, as shown
in the plate, we see below the back-bone a membranous sac
closed and filled with air. This is the air-bladder, a rudiment
of that structure which in higher vertebrates is developed as a
lung. The alimentary canal passes through the abdominal cavity
extending from the mouth through the pharynx and ending at
the anus or vent. The stomach has the form of a blind sac, and
at its termination are a number of tubular sacs, the pyloric
c&aelig;ca, which secrete a digestive fluid. Beyond the pylorus extends
the intestine with one or two loops to the anus. Connected
with the intestine anteriorly is the large red mass of the
liver, with its gall-bladder, which serves as a reservoir for bile,
the fluid the liver secretes. Farther back is another red glandular
mass, the spleen.</p>

<p>In front of the liver and separated from it by a membrane
is the heart. This is of four parts. The posterior part is a
thin-walled reservoir, the sinus venosus, into which blood
enters through the jugular vein from the head and through
the cardinal vein from the kidney. From the sinus venosus
it passes forward into a large thin-walled chamber, the auricle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="700" height="382" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;Dissection of the Blue-green Sunfish, <i>Apomotis cyanellus</i> Rafinesque. (After Kellogg.)&mdash;27.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Next it flows into the thick-walled ventricle, whence by the
rhythmical contraction of its walls it is forced into an arterial
bulb which lies at the base of the ventral aorta, which carries
it on to the gills. After passing through the fine gill-filaments,
it is returned to the dorsal aorta, a large blood-vessel which extends
along the lower surface of the back-bone, giving out branches
from time to time.</p>

<p>The kidneys in fishes constitute an irregular mass under the
back-bone posteriorly. They discharge their secretions through
the ureter to a small urinary bladder, and thence into the urogenital
sinus, a small opening behind the anus. Into the same
sinus are discharged the reproductive cells in both sexes.</p>

<p>In the female sunfish the ovaries consist of two granular
masses of yellowish tissue lying just below and behind the swim-bladder.
In the spring they fill much of the body cavity and
the many little eggs can be plainly seen. When mature they
are discharged through the oviduct to the urogenital sinus. In
some fishes there is no special oviduct and the eggs pass into the
abdominal cavity before exclusion.</p>

<p>In the male the reproductive organs have the same position
as the ovaries in the female. They are, however, much smaller
in size and paler in color, while the minute spermatozoa appear
milky rather than granular on casual examination. A <i>vas deferens</i>
leads from each of these organs into the urogenital sinus.</p>

<p>The lancelets, lampreys, and hagfishes possess no genital
ducts. In the former the germ cells are shed into the atrial
cavity, and from there find their way to the exterior either
through the mouth or the atrial pore; in the latter they are shed
directly into the body cavity, from which they escape through
the abdominal pores. In the sharks and skates the Wolffian
duct in the male, in addition to its function as an excretory duct,
serves also as a passage for the sperm, the testes having a direct
connection with the kidneys. In these forms there is a pair
of M&uuml;llerian ducts which serve as oviducts in the females; they
extend the length of the body cavity, and at their anterior end
have an opening which receives the eggs which have escaped
from the ovary into the body cavity. In some bony fishes as
the eels and female salmon the germ cells are shed into the body
cavity and escape through genital pores, which, however, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
not be homologous with abdominal pores. In most other bony
fishes the testes and ovaries are continued directly into ducts
which open to the outside.</p>

<p><b>Organs of Nutrition.</b>&mdash;The organs thus shown in dissection
we may now examine in detail.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="700" height="361" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>&mdash;Black Swallower, <i>Chiasmodon niger</i> Johnson, containing a fish larger
than itself. Le Have Bank.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The mouth of the fish is the organ or series of structures first
concerned in nutrition. The teeth are outgrowths from the
skin, primarily as modified papill&aelig;, aiding the mouth in its various
functions of seizing, holding, cutting, or crushing the various kinds
of food material. Some fishes feed exclusively on plants, some
on plants and animals alike, some exclusively on animals, some
on the mud in which minute plants and animals occur. The
majority of fishes feed on other fishes, and without much regard
to species or condition. With the carnivorous fishes, to feed represents
the chief activity of the organism. In proportion to the
voracity of the fish is usually the size of the mouth, the sharpness
of the teeth, and the length of the lower jaw.</p>

<p>The most usual type of teeth among fishes is that of villiform
bands. Villiform teeth are short, slender, even, close-set, making
a rough velvety surface. When the teeth are larger and more
widely separated, they are called cardiform, like the teeth of a
wool-card. Granular teeth are small, blunt, and sand-like. Canine
teeth are those projecting above the level of the others,
usually sharp, curved, and in some species barbed. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the canines are in front. In some families the last tooth in
either jaw may be a "posterior canine," serving to hold small
animals in place while the anterior teeth crush them. Canine
teeth are often depressible, having a hinge at base.</p>

<i>Sparisoma aurofrenatum</i>
(Val.). Cuba.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Teeth very slender and brush-like are called setiform. Teeth
with blunt tips are molar. These are usually enlarged and fitted
for crushing shells. Flat teeth set in
mosaic, as in many rays and in the
pharyngeals of parrot-fishes, are said
to be <i>paved</i> or tessellated. Knife-like
teeth, occasionally with serrated edges,
are found in many sharks. Many
fishes have incisor-like teeth, some
flattened and truncate like human
teeth, as in the sheepshead, sometimes
with serrated edges. Often these teeth
are movable, implanted only in the
skin of the lips. In other cases they
are set fast in the jaw. Most species
with movable teeth or teeth with serrated
edges are herbivorous, while
strong incisors may indicate the choice
of snails and crabs as food. Two or
more of these different types may be
found in the same fish. The knife-like teeth of the sharks are
progressively shed, new ones being constantly formed on the
inner margins of the jaw, so that the teeth are marching to be
lost over the edge of the jaw as soon as each has fulfilled its
function. In general the more distinctly a species is a fish-eater,
the sharper are the teeth. Usually fishes show little discrimination
in their choice of food; often they devour the young
of their own species as readily as any other. The digestive
process is rapid, and most fishes rapidly increase in size in the
process of development. When food ceases to be abundant the
fishes grow more slowly. For this reason the same species will
grow to a larger size in large streams than in small ones, in lakes
than in brooks. In most cases there is no absolute limit to
growth, the species growing as long as it lives. But while some
species endure many years, others are certainly very short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>lived,
and some may be even annual, dying after spawning, perhaps
at the end of the first season.</p>

<p>Teeth are wholly absent in several groups of fishes. They
are, however, usually present on the premaxillary, dentary, and
pharyngeal bones. In the higher forms, the vomer, palatines,
and gill-rakers are rarely without teeth, and in many cases the
pterygoids, sphenoids, and the bones of the tongue are similarly
armed.</p>

<p>No salivary glands or palatine velum are developed in fishes.
The tongue is always bony or gristly and immovable. Sometimes
taste-buds are developed on it, and sometimes these are
found on the barbels outside the mouth.</p>

Beaufort, N. C.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;The mouth-cavity opens through the
pharynx between the upper and lower pharyngeal bones into the
&oelig;sophagus, whence the food passes into the stomach. The intestinal
tract is in general divided into four portions&mdash;&oelig;sophagus,
stomach, small and large intestines. But these divisions of the
intestines are not always recognizable, and in the very lowest
forms, as in the lancelet, the stomach is a simple straight tube
without subdivision.</p>

<p>In the lampreys there is a distinction only of the &oelig;sophagus
with many longitudinal folds and the intestine with but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
one. In the bony fishes the stomach is an enlarged area, either
siphon-shaped, with an opening at either end, or else forming
a blind sac with the openings for entrance (cardiac) and exit
(pyloric) close together at the anterior end. In the various
kinds of mullets (<i>Mugil</i>) and in the hickory shad (<i>Dorosoma</i>),
fishes which feed on minute vegetation mixed with mud, the
stomach becomes enlarged to a muscular gizzard, like that of a
fowl. Attached near the pylorus and pouring their secretions
into the duodenum or small intestine are the <i>pyloric c&aelig;ca</i>.
These are tubular sacs secreting a pale fluid and often almost as
long as the stomach or as wide as the intestine. These may be
very numerous as in the salmon, in which case they are likely to
become coalescent at base, or they be few or altogether wanting.</p>

<p>Besides these appendages which are wanting in the higher
vertebrates, a pancreas is also found in the sharks and many
other fishes. This is a glandular mass behind the stomach, its
duct leading into the duodenum and often coalescent with the
bile duct from the liver. The liver in the lancelet is a long
diverticulum of the intestine. In the true fishes it becomes a
large gland of irregular form, and usually but not always provided
with a gall-bladder as in the higher vertebrates. Its
secretions usually pass through a <i>ductus cholodechus</i> to the
duodenum.</p>

<p>The <i>spleen</i>, a dark-red lymphatic gland, is found attached
to the stomach in all fish-like vertebrates except the lancelet.</p>

<p>The lining membrane of the abdominal cavity is known as the
<i>peritoneum</i>, and the membrane sustaining the intestines from
the dorsal side, as in the higher vertebrates, is called the <i>mesentery</i>.
In many species the peritoneum is jet black, while in
related forms it may be pale in color. It is more likely to be
black in fishes from deep water and in fishes which feed on
plants.</p>

<p><b>The Spiral Valve.</b>&mdash;In the sharks or skates the rectum or
large intestine is peculiarly modified, being provided with a spiral
valve, with sometimes as many as forty gyrations. A spiral
valve is also present in the more ancient types of the true fishes
as dipnoans, crossopterygians, and ganoids. This valve greatly
increases the surface of the intestine, doing away with the necessity
for length. In the bowfin (<i>Amia</i>) and the garpike (<i>Lepi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>sosteus</i>)
the valve is reduced to a rudiment of three or four convolutions
near the end of the intestine. In the sharks and
skates the intestine opens into a cloaca, which contains also
the urogenital openings. In all fishes the latter lie behind the
orifice of the intestine. In the bony fishes and the ganoids
there is no cloaca.</p>

air-bladder.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Length of the Intestine.</b>&mdash;In all fishes, as in the higher vertebrates,
the length of the alimentary canal is coordinated with
the food of the fish. In those which feed upon plants the intestine
is very long and much convoluted, while in those which
feed on other fishes it is always relatively short. In the
stone-roller, a fresh-water minnow (<i>Campostoma</i>) found in the
Mississippi Valley, the excessively long intestines filled with
vegetable matter are wound spool-fashion about the large air-bladder.
In all other fishes the air-bladder lies on the dorsal
side of the intestinal canal.</p>

THE SKELETON OF THE FISH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_034.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Specialization</span> of the Skeleton.</b>&mdash;In the lowest form
of fish-like vertebrates (<i>Branchiostoma</i>), the skeleton
consists merely of a cartilaginous rod or notochord
extending through the body just below the spinal
cord. In the lampreys, sharks, dipnoans, crossopterygians,
and sturgeons the skeleton is still cartilaginous, but grows
progressively more complex in their forms and relations.
Among the typical fishes the skeleton becomes ossified and
reaches a very high degree of complexity. Very great variations
in the forms and relations of the different parts of the
skeleton are found among the bony fishes, or teleostei. The
high degree of specialization of these parts gives to the study
of the bones great importance in the systematic arrangement
of these fishes. In fact the true affinities of forms is better
shown by the bones than by any other system of organs. In a
general way the skeleton of the fish is homologous with that of
man. The head in the one corresponds to the head in the other,
the back-bone to the back-bone, and the paired fins, pectoral
and ventral, to the arms and legs.</p>

<p><b>Homologies of Bones of Fishes.</b>&mdash;But this homology does
not extend to the details of structure. The bones of the arm
of the specialized fish are not by any means identical with the
humerus, coracoid, clavicle, radius, ulna, and carpus of the higher
vertebrates. The vertebrate arm is not derived from the
pectoral fin, but both from a cartilaginous shoulder-girdle with
undifferentiated pectoral elements bearing fin-rays, in its details
unlike an arm and unlike the pectoral fin of the specialized fish.</p>

<p>The assumption that each element in the shoulder-girdle and
the pectoral fin of the fish must correspond in detail to the
arm of man has led to great confusion in naming the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
bones. Among the many bones of the fish's shoulder-girdle
and pectoral fin, three or four different ones have successively
borne the names of scapula, clavicle, coracoid, humerus, radius,
and ulna. None of these terms, unless it be clavicle, ought by
rights apply to the fish, for no bone of the fish is a true homologue
of any of these as seen in man. The land vertebrates and
the fishes have doubtless sprung from a common stock, but this
stock, related to the crossopterygians of the present day, was
unspecialized in the details of its skeleton, and from it the fishes
and the higher vertebrates have developed the widely diverging
lines.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;Striped Bass, <i>Roccus lineatus</i> (Bloch). Potomac River.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Parts of the Skeleton.</b>&mdash;The skeleton may be divided into
the head, the vertebral column, and the limbs. The very lowest
of the fish-like forms (<i>Branchiostoma</i>) has no differentiated head
or skull, but in all the other forms the anterior part of the
vertebral column is modified to form a cranium for the protection
of the brain. In the lampreys there are no jaws or other
appendages to the cranium.</p>

<p>In the sharks, dipnoans, crossopterygians, ganoids, and teleosts
or bony fishes, jaws are developed as well as a variety of other
bones around the mouth and throat. The jaw-bearing forms
are sometimes known by the general name of gnathostomes.
In the sharks and their relatives (rays, chim&aelig;ras, etc.) all the
skeleton is composed of cartilage. In the more specialized
bony fishes, besides these bones we find also series of membrane
bones, more or less external to the skull and composed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
ossified dermal tissues. Membrane bones are not found in the
sharks and lampreys, but are developed in an elaborate coat
of mail in some extinct forms.</p>

<p><b>Names of Bones of Fishes.</b>&mdash;In the study of the names of
the bones of fishes it will be more convenient to begin with a
highly specialized form in which each of the various structures
is present and in its normal position.</p>

<p>To this end we present a series of figures of a typical form,
choosing, after Starks, the striped bass (<i>Roccus lineatus</i>) of the
Atlantic coast of the United States. For this set of plates,
drawn from nature by Mrs. Chloe Lesley Starks, we are indebted
to the courtesy of Mr. Edwin Chapin Starks. The figures of the
striped bass illustrate a noteworthy paper on "The Synonymy
of the Fish Skeleton," published by the Washington Academy
of Sciences in 1901.</p>

<p><b>Bones of the Cranium.</b>&mdash;The <i>vomer</i> (1) is the anterior part
of the roof of the mouth, armed with small teeth in the striped
bass and in many other fishes, but often toothless. The <i>ethmoid</i>
(2) lies behind the vomer on the upper surface of the skull,
and the <i>prefrontal</i> (3) projects on either side and behind the
ethmoid, the nostrils usually lying over or near it and near the
nasal bone (51). Between the eyes above are the two <i>frontal</i>
(4) bones joined by a suture. On the side behind the posterior
angle of the frontal is the <i>sphenotic</i> (5) above the posterior part
of the eye. Behind each frontal is the <i>parietal</i> (6). Behind
the parietal and more or less turned inward over the ear-cavity
is the <i>epiotic</i> (7). Between the parietals, and in most fishes
rising into a thin crest, is the <i>supraoccipital</i> (8), which bounds
the cranium above and behind, its posterior margin being
usually a vertical knife-like edge. The <i>pterotic</i> (9) forms a sort
of wing or free margin behind the epiotic and over the ear-cavity.
The <i>opisthotic</i> (10) is a small, hard, irregular bone
behind the pterotic. The <i>exoccipital</i> (11) forms a concave joint
or condyle on each side of the <i>basioccipital</i> (12), by which the
vertebral column is joined to the skull. The <i>parasphenoid</i> (13)
forms a narrow ridge of the roof of the mouth, connecting the
vomer with the basioccipital. In some fishes of primitive structure
(<i>Salmo</i>, <i>Beryx</i>) there is another bone, called orbitosphenoid,
on the middle line above and between the eyes. The <i>basisphe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>noid</i>
(14) is a little bone above the myotome or tube in which
runs the rectus muscle of the eye. It descends toward the
parasphenoid and is attached to the prootic. The <i>prootic</i> (15)
is an irregular bone below the ear region and lying in advance
of the opisthotic. The <i>alisphenoid</i> (16) is a small bone in the
roof of the mouth before the prootic. These sixteen bones
(with a loose bone of specialized form, the <i>otolith</i>, within the
ear-cavity) constitute the cranium. All are well developed
in the striped bass and in most fishes. In some specialized
forms they are much distorted, coossified, or otherwise altered,
and their relations to each other may be more or less changed.
In the lower forms they are not always fully differentiated, but
in nearly all cases their homologies can be readily traced. In
the sharks and lampreys the skull constitutes a continuous
cartilaginous box without sutures. In the dipnoans and other
forms having a bony casque the superficial bones outside the
cranium may not correspond to the cartilaginous elements of
the soft skull itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Bones of the Jaws.</b>&mdash;The bones of the jaws are attached to
the cranium by membranes only, not by sutures, except in a
few peculiarly specialized forms.</p>

<p><i>The Upper Jaw.</i>&mdash;The <i>premaxillary</i> (32) lies on either side
and forms the front of the upper jaw. Its upper posterior tip
or premaxillary spine projects backward almost at right angles
with the rest of the bone into a groove on the ethmoid. There
is often a fold in the skin by which this bone may be thrust
out or protracted, as though drawn out of a sheath. When
the spines of the premaxillary are very long the upper jaw
may be thrust out for a considerable distance. The premaxillary
is also often known as intermaxillary.</p>

<p>Lying behind the premaxillary, its anterior end attached
within the angle of the premaxillary, is the <i>maxillary</i> (31), or
<i>supramaxillary</i>, a flattened bone with expanded posterior tip.
In the striped bass this bone is without teeth, but in many
less specialized forms, as the salmon, it is provided with teeth
and joined to the premaxillary in a different fashion. In any
case its position readily distinguishes it. In some cases the maxillary
is divided by one or more sutures, setting off from it one
or more extra maxillary (supplemental maxillary) bones. This
suture is absent in the striped bass, but distinct in the black bass,
and more than one suture is found in the shad and herring. The
roof of the mouth above is formed by a number of bones, which,
as they often possess teeth, may be considered with the jaws.
These are the <i>palatine</i> bones (21), one on either side flanking
the vomer, the <i>pterygoid</i> (20), behind it and articulating with
it, the <i>mesopterygoid</i> (22), on the roof of the mouth toward the
median line, and the <i>metapterygoid</i> (23), lying behind this. Although
often armed with teeth, these bones are to be considered
of the general nature of the membrane bones. In some degraded
types of fishes (eels, morays, congers) the premaxillary
is indistinguishable, being united with the vomer and palatines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The upper jaw of the shark is formed from the anterior portion
of the palatine bones, which are not separate from the
quadrate, the whole forming the palato-quadrate apparatus. In
the him&aelig;ra and the dipnoans this apparatus is solidly united
with the cranium. In these fishes the true upper jaw, formed
of maxillary and premaxillary, is wanting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="700" height="504" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;Lower jaw of <i>Amia calva</i> (Linn&aelig;us), showing the gular plate.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>The Lower Jaw.</i>&mdash;The lower jaw or mandible is also complex,
consisting of two divisions or rami, right and left, joined
in front by a suture. The anterior part of each ramus is formed
by the <i>dentary bone</i> (30), which carries the teeth. Behind this
is the <i>articular bone</i> (28), which is connected by a joint to the
<i>quadrate bone</i> (19). At the lower angle of the articular bone
is the small <i>angular bone</i> (29). In many cases another small
bone, which is called <i>splenial</i>, may be found attached to the inner
surface of the articular bone. This little bone has been called
coronoid, but it is doubtless not homologous with the coronoid
bone of reptiles. In a few fishes, <i>Amia</i>, <i>Elopid&aelig;</i>, and certain
fossil dipnoans, there is a bony gular plate, a membrane bone
across the throat behind the chin on the lower jaw.</p>

<p><b>The Suspensorium of the Mandible.</b>&mdash;The lower jaw is attached
to the cranium by a chain of suspensory bones, which
vary a good deal with different groups of fishes. The articular
is jointed with the flat quadrate bone (19), which lies behind
the pterygoid. A slender bone passes upward (18) under the
preopercle and the metapterygoid, forming a connection above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
with a large flattish bone, the <i>hyomandibular</i> (17), which in turn
joins the cranium. The slender bone which thus keys together
the upper and lower elements, hyomandibular and quadrate,
forming the suspensorium of the lower jaw, is known as <i>symplectic</i>
(18). The hyomandibular is thought to be homologous
with the stapes, or stirrup-bone, of the ear in higher animals.
In this case the symplectic may be homologous with its small
orbicular bone, and the malleus is a transformation of the
articular. The incus, or anvil-bone, may be formed from part
of Meckel's cartilage. All these homologies are however extremely
hypothetical. The core of the lower jaw is formed of a
cartilage called Meckel's cartilage, outside which the membrane
bones, dentary, etc., are developed. This cartilage forms the
lower jaw in sharks, true jaw-bones not being developed in these
fishes. In lampreys and lancelets there is no lower jaw.</p>

<p><b>Membrane Bones of Face.</b>&mdash;The membrane bones lie on the
surface of the head, when they are usually covered by thin skin
and have only a superficial connection with the cranium. Such
bones, formed of ossified membrane, are not found in the earlier
or less specialized fishes, the lancelets and lampreys, nor in the
sharks, rays, and chim&aelig;ras. They are chiefly characteristic of
the bony fishes, although in some of these they have undergone
degradation.</p>

<p>The <i>preorbital</i> (49) lies before and below the eye, its edge
more or less parallel with that of the maxillary. It may be
broad or narrow. When broad it usually forms a sheath into
which the maxillary slips. The <i>nasal</i> (51) lies before the preorbital,
a small bone usually lying along the spine of the premaxillary.
Behind and below the eye is a series of about three
flat bones, the <i>suborbitals</i> (50), small in the striped bass, but
sometimes considerably modified. In the great group of loricate
fishes (sculpins, etc.), the third suborbital sends a bony process
called the suborbital stay backward across the cheek toward
the preopercle. The suborbital stay is present in the rosefish.
In some cases, as in the gurnard, this stay covers the whole cheek
with a bony coat of mail. In some fishes, but not in the striped
bass, a small supraorbital bone exists over the eye, forming a
sort of cap on an angle of the frontal bone.</p>

<p>The largest uppermost flat bone of the gill-covers is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
as the <i>opercle</i> (25). Below it, joined by a suture, is the <i>subopercle</i>
(26). Before it is the prominent ridge of the <i>preopercle</i>
(24), which curves forward below and forms a more or less
distinct angle, often armed with serrations or spines. In some
cases this armature is very highly developed. The <i>interopercle</i>
(27) lies below the preopercle and parallel with the lower limb.</p>

<p><b>Branchial Bones.</b>&mdash;The bones of the branchial apparatus or
gills are very numerous and complex, as well as subject to important
variations. In many fishes some of these bones are coossified,
and in other cases some are wanting. The tongue may
be considered as belonging to this series, as the bones of the
gills are attached to its axis below.</p>

<p>In the striped bass, as in most fishes, the tongue, gristly and
immovable, is formed anteriorly by a bone called the <i>glossohyal</i>
(37). Behind this are the <i>basihyals</i> (36), and still farther back,
on the side, is the <i>ceratohyal</i> (35). To the basihyals is attached
a bone extending downward and free behind the <i>urohyal</i> (38).
Behind the ceratohyal and continuous with it is the <i>epihyal</i> (34),
to which behind is attached the narrow <i>interhyal</i> (33). On the
under surface of the <i>ceratohyal</i> and the <i>epihyal</i> are attached
the <i>branchiostegals</i> (39). These are slender rays supporting a
membrane beneath the gills, seven in number on each side in the
striped bass, but much more numerous in some groups of fishes.
The gill membranes connecting the branchiostegals are in the
striped bass entirely separate from each other. In other fishes
they may be broadly joined across the fleshy interspace between
the gill-openings, known as the <i>isthmus</i>, or again they may be
grown fast to the isthmus itself, so that the gill-openings of the
two sides are widely separated.</p>

<p><b>The Gill-arches.</b>&mdash;The gills are attached to four bony arches
with a fifth of the same nature, but totally modified by the
presence of teeth, and very rarely having on it any of the gill-fringes.
The fifth arch thus modified to serve in mastication
instead of respiration is known collectively as the <i>lower pharyngeals</i>
(46). Opposite these are the <i>upper pharyngeals</i> (45).</p>

<p>The gill-arches are suspended to the cranium from above by
the <i>suspensory pharyngeal</i> (44). Each arch contains three parts&mdash;the
<i>epibranchial</i> (43), above, the <i>ceratobranchial</i> (42), forming
the middle part, and the <i>hypobranchial</i> (41), the lower part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
articulating with the series of <i>basibranchials</i> (40) which lie
behind the epihyal of the tongue. On the three bones forming
the first gill-arch are attached numerous appendages called <i>gill-rakers</i>
(47). These gill-rakers vary very greatly in number and
form. In the striped bass they are few and spear-shaped. In
the shad they are very many and almost as fine as hairs. In
some fishes they form an effective strainer in separating the
food, or perhaps in keeping extraneous matter from the gills.
In some fishes they are short and lumpy, in others wanting
altogether.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Pharyngeals.</b>&mdash;The hindmost gill-arch, as above stated,
is modified to form a sort of jaw. The tooth-bearing bones
above, 2 to 4 pairs, are known as <i>upper pharyngeals</i> (45), those
below, single pair, as <i>lower pharyngeals</i> (46). Of these the
lower pharyngeals are most highly specialized and the most
useful in classification. These are usually formed much as in
the striped bass. Occasionally they are much enlarged, with
large teeth for grinding. In many families the lower pharyngeals
are grown together in one large bone. In the suckers
(<i>Catostomid&aelig;</i>) the lower pharyngeal preserves its resemblance
to a gill-arch. In the carp family (<i>Cyprinid&aelig;</i>) retaining this resemblance,
it possesses highly specialized teeth.</p>

<p><b>Vertebral Column.</b>&mdash;The vertebral column is composed of a
series of vertebr&aelig;, 24 in number in the striped bass and in
many of the higher fishes, but varying in different groups from
16 to 18 to upwards of 400, the higher numbers being evidence
of unspecialized or more usually degenerate structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Each vertebra consists of a double concave body or <i>centrum</i>
(66). Above it are two small projections often turned backward,
<i>zygapophyses</i> (71), and two larger ones, <i>neurapophyses</i>
(67), which join above to form the <i>neural spine</i> (68) and thus
form the <i>neural canal</i>, through which passes the spinal cord
from end to end of the body.</p>

</div>

<p>Below in the vertebr&aelig; of the posterior half of the body the
<i>h&aelig;mapophyses</i> (69) unite to form the <i>h&aelig;mal spine</i> (70), and
through the <i>h&aelig;mal canal</i> thus formed passes a great artery. The
vertebr&aelig; having h&aelig;mal as well as neural spines are known as
<i>caudal vertebr&aelig;</i>, and occupy the posterior part of the body,
usually that behind the attachment of the <i>anal fin</i> (78).</p>

<p>The anterior vertebr&aelig; known as <i>abdominal vertebr&aelig;</i>, bounding
the body-cavity, possess neural spines similar to those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the caudal vertebr&aelig;. In place, however, of the h&aelig;mapophyses
are projections known as <i>parapophyses</i> (72), which do not meet
below, but extend outward, forming the upper part of the wall
of the abdominal cavity.</p>

loosely attached and each rib may have one or more accessory

<p>In the striped bass the dorsal vertebr&aelig; are essentially
similar in form, but in some fishes, as the carp and the catfish,
4 or 5 anterior vertebr&aelig; are greatly modified, coossified,
and so arranged as to connect the air-bladder with the organ
of hearing. Fishes with vertebr&aelig; thus altered are called <i>plectospondylous</i>.</p>

<p>In the garpike the vertebr&aelig; are convex anteriorly, concave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
behind, being joined by ball-and-socket joints (opisthoc&oelig;lian).
In most other fishes they are double concave (amplic&oelig;lian).
In sharks the vertebr&aelig; are imperfectly ossified, a number of
terms, asterospondylous, cyclospondylous, tectospondylous, being
applied to the different stages of ossification, these terms referring
to the different modes of arrangement of the calcareous material
within the vertebra.</p>

<p><b>The Interneurals and Interh&aelig;mals.</b>&mdash;The vertical fins are
connected with the skeletons by bones placed loosely in the
flesh and not joined by ligament or suture. Below the dorsal
fin (76) lies a series of these bones, dagger-shaped, with the
point downward. These are called <i>interneurals</i> (75) and to
these the spines and soft rays of the fin are articulated.</p>

<p>In like fashion the spines and rays of the anal fin (18) are
jointed at base to bones called <i>interh&aelig;mals</i> (77). In certain
cases the second interh&aelig;mal is much enlarged, made hollow and
quill-shaped, and in its concave upper end the tip of the air-bladder
is received. This structure is seen in the plume-fishes
(<i>Calamus</i>). These two groups of bones, interneural and interh&aelig;mal,
are sometimes collectively called <i>inter-spinals</i>. The flattened
basal bone of the <i>caudal fin</i> (80) is known as <i>hypural</i> (79).</p>

</div>

<p>The tail of the striped bass, ending in a broad plate which
supports the caudal, is said to be homocercal. In more primitive
forms the tail is turned upward more or less, the fin being
largely thrown to its lower side. Such a tail as in the sturgeon
is said to be heterocercal. In the isocercal tail of the codfish
and its relatives the vertebr&aelig; are progressively smaller behind
and the hypural plate is obsolete or nearly so, the vertebr&aelig;
remaining in the line of the axis of the body and dividing the
caudal fin equally. The simplest form of tail, called diphycercal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
is extended horizontally, tapering backward, the fin equally
divided above and below, without hypural plate. In any form
of the tail, it may through degeneration be attenuate or whip-like,
a form called leptocercal.</p>

<p><b>The Pectoral Limb.</b>&mdash;The four limbs of the fish are represented
by the paired fins. The anterior limb is represented
by the pectoral fin and its basal elements with the shoulder-girdle,
which in the bony fishes reaches a higher degree of complexity
than in any other vertebrates. It is in connection with
the shoulder-girdle that the greatest confusion in names has
occurred. This is due to an attempt to homologize its parts
with the shoulder-girdle (scapula, coracoid, and clavicle) of higher
vertebrates. But it is not evident that a bony fish possesses
a real scapula, coracoid, or even clavicle. The parts of its
shoulder-girdle are derived by one line of descent from the undifferentiated
elements of the cartilaginous shoulder-girdle of
ancestral crossopterygian or dipnoan forms. From a similar
ancestry by another line of differentiation has come the amphibian
and reptilian shoulder-girdle and its derivative, the
girdle of birds and mammals.</p>

<p><b>The Shoulder-girdle.</b>&mdash;In the higher fishes the uppermost
bone of the shoulder-girdle is called the <i>post-temporal</i> (<i>suprascapula</i>)
(53). In the striped bass and in most fishes this
bone is jointed to the temporal region of the cranium. Sometimes,
as in the trigger-fishes, it is grown fast to the skull, but
it usually rests lightly with the three points of its upper end.
In sharks and skates the shoulder-girdle, which is formed of a
continuous cartilage, does not touch the skull. In the eels and
their allies, it has, by degradation, lost its connection and the
post-temporal rests in the flesh behind the cranium.</p>

<p>The post-temporal sometimes projects behind through the
skin and may bear spines or serrations. In front of the post-temporal
and a little to the outside of it is the small <i>supratemporal</i>
(52) also usually connecting the shoulder-girdle with
the skull. Below the post-temporal, extending downward and
backward, is the flattish <i>supraclavicle</i> (<i>posterotemporal</i>) (54). To
this is joined the long <i>clavicle</i> (<i>proscapula</i>) (55), which runs
forward and downward in the bony fishes, meeting its fellow on
the opposite side in a manner suggesting the wishbone of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
fowl. Behind the base of the clavicle, the sword-shaped post-clavicle
(56) extends downward through the muscles behind the
base of the pectoral fin. In some fishes,
as the stickleback and the trumpet-fish, a
pair of flattish or elongate bones called
<i>interclavicles</i> (<i>infraclavicles</i>) lie between
and behind the lower part of the clavicle.
These are not found in most fishes and
are wanting in the striped bass. They are
probably in all cases merely extensions of
the hypocoracoid.</p>

bubalus</i> Rafinesque,

(59). (After Starks.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two flat bones side by side lie at the
base of the pectoral fin, their anterior edges
against the upper part of the clavicle.
These are the <i>hypercoracoid</i> (57), above,
and <i>hypocoracoid</i> (58), below. These have
been variously called scapula, coracoid,
humerus, radius, and ulna, but being found
in the higher fishes only and not in the
higher vertebrates, they should receive
names not used for other structures. The hypercoracoid is
usually pierced by a round foramen or fenestra, but in some
fishes (cods, weavers) the fenestra is between the two bones.
Attached to the hypercoracoid in the striped bass are four
little bones shaped like an hour-glass. These are the <i>actinosts</i>
(60) (<i>carpals</i> or <i>pterygials</i>), which support the rays of the pectoral
fin (61). In most bony fishes these are placed much as
in the striped bass, but in certain specialized or aberrant forms
their form and position are greatly altered.</p>

<p>In the anglers (<i>Pediculati</i>) the "carpals" are much elongated,
forming a kind of arm, by which the fish can execute a motion
not unlike walking.</p>

<p>In the Alaska blackfish (<i>Dallia pectoralis</i>) the two coracoids
are represented by a thin, cartilaginous plate, imperfectly
divided, and there are no actinosts. In almost all bony
fishes, however, these bones are well differentiated and distinct.
In most of the soft-rayed fishes an additional V-shaped bone
or arch exists on the inner surface of the shoulder-girdle near
the insertion of the hypercoracoid. This is known as the <i>meso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>coracoid</i>
(59). It is not found in the striped bass, but is found
in the carp, catfish, salmon, and all their allies.</p>

<p>In the shark the pelvic girdle is rather largely developed,
but in the more specialized fishes it loses its importance. In
the less specialized of the bony fishes the pelvis is attached at
a distance from the head among the muscles of the side, and
free from the shoulder-girdle and other parts of the skeleton.
The ventral fins are then said to be abdominal. When very close
to the clavicle, but not connected with it, as in the mullet, the
fin is still said to be abdominal or subabdominal. In the
striped bass the pelvis is joined by ligament between the clavicles,
near their tip. The ventral fins thus connected, as seen in
most spiny-rayed fishes, are said to be thoracic. In certain
forms the pelvis is thrown still farther forward and attached at
the throat or even to the chin. When the ventral fins are thus
inserted before the shoulder-girdle, they are said to be jugular.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Most of the fishes with spines in the fins have thoracic ventrals.
In the fishes with jugular ventrals these fins have begun
a process of degeneration by which the spines or soft rays or
both are lost or atrophied.</p>

<p><b>Degeneration.</b>&mdash;By degeneration or degradation in biology
is meant merely a reduction to a lower degree of complexity
or specialization in structure. If in the process of development
of the individual some particular organ loses its complexity it
is said to be degenerate. If in the geological history of a type
the same change takes place the same term is used. Degeneration
in this sense is, like specialization, a phase of adaptation.
It does not imply disease, feebleness, or mutilation, or any tendency
toward extinction. It is also necessary to distinguish
clearly phases of primitive simplicity from the apparent simplicity
resulting from degeneration.</p>

<p><b>The Skeleton in Primitive Fishes.</b>&mdash;To learn the names of bones
we can deal most satisfactorily with the higher fishes, those in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
which the bony framework has attained completion. But to
understand the origin and relation of parts we must begin with
the lowest types, tracing the different stages
in the development of each part of the
system.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 411px;">

</div>

<p>In the lancelets (<i>Leptocardii</i>), the vertebral
column consists simply of a gelatinous
notochord extending from one end of the
fish to the other, and pointed at both ends,
no skull being developed. The notochord
never shows traces of segmentation, although
cartilaginous rods above it are thought to
forecast apophyses. In these forms there is
no trace of jaws, limbs, or ribs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>In the embryo of the bony fish a similar
notochord precedes the segmentation and
ossification of the vertebral column. In
most of the extinct types of fishes a notochord more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
modified persisted through life, the vertebr&aelig; being strung upon
it spool fashion in various stages of development. In the Cyclostomi
(lampreys and hagfishes) the limbs and lower jaw are
still wanting, but a distinct skull is developed. The notochord
is still present, but its anterior pointed end is wedged into
the base of a cranial capsule, partly membranous, partly cartilaginous.
There is no trace of segmentation in the notochord
itself in these or any other fishes, but neutral arches are foreshadowed
in a series of cartilages on each side of the spinal
chord. The top of the head is protected by broad plates.
There are ring-like cartilages supporting the mouth and other
cartilages in connection with the tongue and gill structures.</p>

<p><b>The Skeleton of Sharks.</b>&mdash;In the Elasmobranchs (sharks,
rays, chim&aelig;ras) the tissues surrounding the notochord are segmented
and in most forms distinct vertebr&aelig; are developed.
Each of these has a conical cavity before and behind, with a
central canal through which the notochord is continued. The
form and degree of ossification of these vertebr&aelig; differ materially
in the different groups. The skull in all these fishes is cartilaginous,
forming a continuous undivided box containing the brain and
lodging the organs of sense. To the skull in the shark is attached a
suspensorium of one or two pieces supporting the mandible and
the hyoid structures. In the chim&aelig;ra the mandible is articulated
directly with the skull, the hyomandibular and quadrate
elements being fused with the cranium. The skull in such case is
said to be <i>autostylic</i>, that is, with self-attached mandible. In the
shark it is said to be <i>hyostylic</i>, the hyomandibular intervening.
The upper jaw in the shark consists not of maxillary and
premaxillary but of palatine elements, and the two halves of
the lower jaw are representatives of Meckel's cartilage, which
is the cartilaginous centre of the dentary bone in the bony
fishes. These jaw-bones in the higher fishes are in the nature
of membrane bones, and in the sharks and their relatives all
such bones are undeveloped. The hyoid structures are in the
shark relatively simple, as are also the gill-arches, which vary
in number. The vertical fins are supported by interneural and
interh&aelig;mal cartilages, to which the soft fin-rays are attached
without articulation.</p>

<p>The shoulder-girdle is made of a single cartilage, touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the back-bone at a distance behind the head. To this cartilage
three smaller ones are attached, forming the base of the pectoral
fin. These are called <i>mesopterygium</i>, <i>propterygium</i>, and <i>metapterygium</i>,
the first named
being in the middle and
more distinctly basal.
These three segments are
subject to much variation.
Sometimes one of
them is wanting; sometimes
two are grown together.
Behind these the
fin-rays are attached. In
most of the skates the
shoulder-girdle is more
closely connected with
the anterior vertebr&aelig;,
which are more or less
fused together.</p>

</div>

<p>The pelvis, remote
from the head, is formed,
in the shark, of a single
or paired cartilage with
smaller elements at the
base of the fin-rays. In
the males a cartilaginous
generative organ, known
as the clasper, is attached
to the pelvis and the
ventral fins. In the
Elasmobranchs the tail
vertebr&aelig; are progressively smaller backward. If a caudal fin
is present, the last vertebr&aelig; are directed upward (<i>heterocercal</i>)
and the greater part of the fin is below the axis. In other forms
(sting-rays) the tail degenerates into a whip-like organ (<i>leptocercal</i>),
often without fins. In certain primitive sharks (Ichthyotomi),
as well as in the Dipnoi and Crossopterygii, the tail is
<i>diphycercal</i>, the vertebr&aelig; growing progressively smaller backward
and not bent upward toward the tip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>In the chim&aelig;ras (<i>Holocephali</i>) the notochord persists and is
surrounded by a series of calcified rings. The palate with the
suspensorium is coalesced with the skull, and the teeth are grown
together into bony plates.</p>

Ganoids represent various phases of transition from the ancient
cartilaginous types to the modern bony fishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Ichthyotomous sharks, Dipnoans, and Crossopterygians
the segments of the pectoral limb are arranged axially,
or one beyond another. This type of fin has been called
<i>archipterygium</i> by Gegenbaur, on the theory that it represents
the condition shown on the first appearance of the pectoral fin.
This theory is now seriously questioned, but it will be convenient
to retain the name for the pectoral fin with segmented axis
fringed on one or both sides by soft rays.</p>

</div>

<p>The archipterygium of the Dipnoan genus <i>Neoceratodus</i> is
thus described by Dr. G&uuml;nther ("Guide to the Study of Fishes,"
p. 73): "The pectoral limb is covered with small scales along the
middle from the root to the extremity, and is surrounded by a
rayed fringe similar to the rays of the vertical fins. A muscle
split into numerous fascicles extends all the length of the fin,
which is flexible in every part and in every direction. The
cartilaginous framework supporting it is joined to the scapular
arch by a broad basal cartilage, generally single, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
showing traces of a triple division. Along the middle of the
fin runs a jointed axis gradually becoming smaller and thinner
towards the extremity. Each joint bears on each side a three-,
two-, or one-jointed branch."</p>

<p>In the genus <i>Lepidosiren</i>, also a Dipnoan, the pectoral limb
has the same axial structure, but is without fin-rays, although
in the breeding season the posterior limb or ventral fin in the
male is covered with a brush of fine filaments. This structure,
according to Prof. J. G. Kerr,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is probably without definite
function, but belongs to the "category of modifications so often
associated with the breeding season (cf. the newts' crest) commonly
called ornamental, but which are perhaps more plausibly
looked upon as expressions of the intense vital activity of the
organisms correlated with its period of reproductive activity."
Professor Kerr, however, thinks it not unlikely that this brush of
filaments with its rich blood-supply may serve in the function
of respiration, a suggestion first made by Professor Lankester.</p>

MORPHOLOGY OF THE FINS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_062.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Origin</span> of the Fins of Fishes.</b>&mdash;One of the most interesting
problems in vertebrate morphology, and one of
the most important from its wide-reaching relations, is
that of the derivation of the fins of fishes. This resolves
itself at once into two problems, the origin of the median fins,
which appear in the lancelets, at the very bottom of the fish-like
series, and the origin of the paired fins or limbs, which are much
more complex, and which first appear with the primitive sharks.</p>

<p>In this study the problem is to ascertain not what theoretically
should happen, but what, as a matter of fact, has happened
in the early history of the fish-like groups. That these structures,
with the others in the fish body, have sprung from simple
origins, growing more complex with the demands of varied
conditions, and then at times again simple, through degeneration,
there can be no doubt. It is also certain that each structure
must have had some element of usefulness in all its
stages. In such studies we have, as H&aelig;ckel has expressed it,
"three ancestral documents, paleontology, morphology, and ontogeny"&mdash;the
actual history as shown by fossil remains, the sidelight
derived from comparison of structures, and the evidence
of the hereditary influences shown in the development of the
individual. As to the first of these ancestral documents, the
evidence of paleontology is conclusive where it is complete.
But in very few cases are we sure of any series of details. The
records of geology are like a book with half its leaves torn out,
the other half confused, displaced, and blotted. Still each record
actually existing represents genuine history, and in paleontology
we must in time find our final court of appeal in all matters
of biological origins.</p>

<p>The evidence of comparative anatomy is most completely
secured, but it is often indecisive as to relative age and primi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>tiveness
of origin among structures. As to ontogeny, it is, of
course, true that through heredity "the life-history of the individual
is an epitome of the life-history of the race." "Ontogeny
repeats phylogeny," and phylogeny, or line of descent of
organisms and structures, is what we are seeking. But here
the repetition is never perfect, never nearly so perfect in fact as
H&aelig;ckel and his followers expected to find it. The demands
of natural selection may lead to the lengthening, shortening,
or distortion of phases of growth, just as they may modify
adult conditions. The interpolation of non-ancestral stages is
recognized in several groups. The conditions of the individual
development may, therefore, furnish evidence in favor of certain
theories of origins, but they cannot alone furnish the absolute
proof.</p>

<p>In the process of development the median or vertical fins
are doubtless older than the paired fins or limbs, whatever be
the origin of the latter. They arise in a dermal keel which is
developed in a web fitting and accentuating the undulatory
motion of the body. In the embryo of the fish the continuous
vertical fin from the head along the back and around the tail
precedes any trace of the paired fins.</p>

<p>In this elementary fin-fold slender supports, the rudiments
of fin-rays, tend to appear at intervals. These are called by
Ryder ray-hairs or actinotrichia. They are the prototype of
fin-rays in the embryo fish, and doubtless similarly preceded
the latter in geological time. In the development of fishes
the caudal fin becomes more and more the seat of propulsion.
The fin-rays are strengthened, their basal supports are more
and more specialized, and the fin-fold ultimately divides into
distinct fins, the longest rays developed where most needed.</p>

<p>That the vertical fins, dorsal, anal, and caudal, have their
origin in a median fold of the skin admits of no question.
In the lowest forms which bear fins these structures are dermal
folds, being supported by very feeble rays. Doubtless at first
the vertical fins formed a continuous fold, extending around
the tail, this fold ultimately broken, by atrophy of parts not
needed, into distinct dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. In the
lower fishes, as in the earlier sharks, there is an approach
to this condition of primitive continuity, and in the embryos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of almost all fishes the same condition occurs. Dr. John A.
Ryder points out the fact that there are certain unexplained exceptions
to this rule. The sea-horse, pipefish, and other highly
modified forms do not show this unbroken fold, and it is wanting
in the embryo of the top-minnow, <i>Gambusia affinis</i>. Nevertheless
the existence of a continuous vertical fold in the embryo
is the rule, almost universal. The codfish with three dorsals,
the Spanish mackerel with dorsal and anal finlets, the herring
with one dorsal, the stickleback with a highly modified one, all
show this character, and we may well regard it as a certain trait
of the primitive fish. This fold springs from the ectoblast or
external series of cells in the embryo. The fin-rays and bony
supports of the fins spring from the mesoblast or middle series
of cells, being thrust upward from the skeleton as supports for
the fin-fold.</p>

<p><b>Origin of the Paired Fins.</b>&mdash;The question of the origin of the
paired fins is much more difficult and is still far from settled,
although many, perhaps the majority of recent writers favor the
theory that these fins are parts of a once continuous lateral
fold of skin, corresponding to the vertical fold which forms the
dorsal, anal, and caudal. In this view the lateral fold, at first
continuous, became soon atrophied in the middle, while at either
end it is highly specialized, at first into an organ of direction,
then into fan-shaped and later paddle-shaped organs of locomotion.
According to another view, the paired fins originated from
gill structures, originally both close behind the head, the ventral
fin migrating backward with the progress of evolution of the
species.</p>

<p><b>Evidence of Paleontology.</b>&mdash;If we had representations of all
the early forms of fishes arranged in proper sequence, we could
decide once for all, by evidence of paleontology, which form of
fin appears first and what is the order of appearance. As to
this, it is plain that we do not know the most primitive form
of fin. Sharks of unknown character must have existed long
before the earliest remains accessible to us. Hence the evidence
of paleontology seems conflicting and uncertain. On the whole
it lends most support to the fin-fold theory. In the later
Devonian, a shark, <i>Cladoselache fyleri</i>, is found in which the
paired fins are lappet-shaped, so formed and placed as to suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
their origin from a continuous fold of skin. In this species the
dorsal fins show much the same form. Other early sharks, constituting
the order of <i>Acanthodei</i>, have fins somewhat similar,
but each preceded by a stiff spine, which may be formed from
coalescent rays.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span>&mdash;Fold-like pectoral and ventral fins of <i>Cladoselache fyleri</i>. (After Dean.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Long after these appears another type of sharks represented
by <i>Pleuracanthus</i> and <i>Cladodus</i>, in which the pectoral fin is a
jointed organ fringed with rays arranged serially in one or two
rows. This form of fin has no resemblance to a fold of skin,
but accords better with Gegenbaur's theory that the pectoral
limb was at first a modified gill-arch. In the Coal Measures
are found also teeth of sharks (<i>Orodontid&aelig;</i>) which bear a
strong resemblance to still existing forms of the family of
<i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>, which originates in the Permian. The existing
<i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i> have the usual specialized form of shark-fin, with
three of the basal segments especially enlarged and placed side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
by side, the type seen in modern sharks. Whatever the primitive
form of shark-fin, it may well be doubted whether any one
of these three (<i>Cladoselache</i>, <i>Pleuracanthus</i>, or <i>Heterodontus</i>)
actually represents it. The beginning is therefore unknown,
though there is some evidence that <i>Cladoselache</i> is actually
more nearly primitive than any of the others. As we shall see,
the evidence of comparative anatomy may be consistent with
either of the two chief theories, while that of ontogeny or embryology
is apparently inconclusive, and that of paleontology
is apparently most easily reconciled with the theory of the fin-fold.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span>&mdash;Pectoral fin of shark, <i>Chiloscyllium</i>. (After Parker and Haswell.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Development of the Paired Fins in the Embryo.</b>&mdash;According to
Dr. John A. Ryder ("Embryography of Osseous Fishes," 1882)
"the paired fins in Teleostei arise locally, as short longitudinal
folds, with perhaps a few exceptions. The pectorals of <i>Lepisosteus</i>
originate in the same way. Of the paired fins, the pectoral
or anterior pair seems to be the first to be developed, the ventral
or pelvic pair often not making its appearance until after the
absorption of the yolk-sac has been completed, in other cases
before that event, as in <i>Salmo</i> and in <i>Gambusia</i>. The pectoral
fin undergoes less alteration of position during its evolution
than the posterior pair."</p>

<p>In the codfish (<i>Gadus callarias</i>) the pectoral fin-fold "appears
as a slight longitudinal elevation of the skin on either
side of the body of the embryo a little way behind the auditory
vesicles, and shortly after the tail of the embryo begins to bud
out. At the very first it appears to be merely a dermal fold,
and in some forms a layer of cells extends out underneath it
from the sides of the body, but does not ascend into it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
begins to develop as a very low fold, hardly noticeable, and, as
growth proceeds, its base does not expand antero-posteriorly,
but tends rather to become narrowed, so that it has a pedunculated
form. With the progress of this process the margin of the
fin-fold also becomes thinner at its distal border, and at the
basal part mesodermal cells make their appearance more noticeably
within the inner contour-line. The free border of the fin-fold
grows out laterally and longitudinally, expanding the portion
outside of the inner contour-line of the fin into a fan-shape.
This distal thinner portion is at first without any evidence of
rays; further than that there is a manifest tendency to a radial
disposition of the histological elements of the fin."</p>

<p>The next point of interest is found in the change of position
of the pectoral fin by a rotation on its base. This is associated
with changes in the development of the fish itself. The ventral
fin is also, in most fishes, a short horizontal fold and just above
the preanal part of the median vertical fold which becomes anal,
caudal, and dorsal. But in the top-minnow (<i>Gambusia</i>), of the
order Haplomi, the ventral first appears as "a little papilla and
not as a fold, where the body-walls join the hinder upper portion
of the yolk-sac, a very little way in front of the vent."
"These two modes of origin," observes Dr. Ryder, "are therefore
in striking contrast and well calculated to impress us with the
protean character of the means at the disposal of Nature to
achieve one and the same end."</p>

<p><b>Current Theories as to Origin of Paired Fins.</b>&mdash;There are three
chief theories as to the morphology and origin of the paired fins.
The earliest is that of Dr. Karl Gegenbaur, supported by
various workers among his students and colleagues. In his view
the pectoral and ventral fins are derived from modifications of
primitive gill-arches. According to this theory, the skeletal
arrangements of the vertebrate limb are derived from modifications
of one primitive form, a structure made up of successive
joints, with a series of fin-rays on one or both sides of it. To
this structure Gegenbaur gives the name of archipterygium.
It is found in the shark, <i>Pleuracanthus</i>, in <i>Cladodus</i>, and in
all the Dipnoan and Crossopterygian fishes, its primitive form
being still retained in the Australian genus of Dipnoans, <i>Neoceratodus</i>.
This biserial archipterygium with its limb-girdle is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
derived from a series of gill-rays attached to a branchial arch.
The backward position of the ventral fin is due to a succession
of migrations in the individual and in the species.</p>

<p>As to this theory, Mr. J. Graham Kerr observes:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="700" height="333" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span>&mdash;Skull and shoulder-girdle of <i>Neoceratodus forsteri</i> (G&uuml;nther), showing the
archipterygium.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The Gegenbaur theory of the morphology of vertebrate
limbs thus consists of two very distinct portions. The first,
that the archipterygium is the ground-form from which all other
forms of presently existing fin skeletons are derived, concerns
us only indirectly, as we are dealing here only with the <i>origin</i>
of the limbs, i.e., their origin from other structures that were
not limbs.</p>

<p>"It is the second part of the view that we have to do with,
that deriving the archipterygium, the skeleton of the primitive
paired fin, from a series of gill-rays and involving the idea that
the limb itself is derived from the septum between two gill-clefts.</p>

<p>"This view is based on the skeletal structures within the fin.
It rests upon (1) the assumption that the archipterygium is
the primitive type of fin, and (2) the fact that amongst the
Selachians is found a tendency for one branchial ray to become
larger than the others, and, when this has happened, for the
base of attachment of neighboring rays to show a tendency
to migrate from the branchial arch on to the base of the larger
or, as we may call it, primary ray; a condition coming about
which, were the process to continue rather farther than it is
known to do in actual fact, would obviously result in a struc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>ture
practically identical with the archipterygium. Gegenbaur
suggests that the archipterygium actually has arisen in this
way in phylogeny."</p>

</div>

<p>The fin-fold theory of Balfour, adopted by Dohrn, Weidersheim,
Thacher, Mivart, Ryder, Dean, Boulenger, and others, and
now generally accepted by most morphologists as plausible, is
this: that "The paired limbs are persisting and exaggerated
portions of a fin-fold once continuous, which stretched along
each side of the body and to which they bear an exactly similar
phylogenetic relation as do the separate dorsal and anal fins
to the once continuous median fin-fold."</p>

<p>"This view, in its modern form, was based by Balfour on
his observation that in the embryos of certain Elasmobranchs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the rudiments of the pectoral and pelvic fins are at a very
early period connected together by a longitudinal ridge of thickened
epiblast&mdash;of which indeed they are but exaggerations. In
Balfour's own words referring to these observations: 'If the
account just given of the development of the limb is an accurate
record of what really takes place, it is not possible to deny
that some light is thrown by it upon the first origin of the vertebrate
limbs. The facts can only bear one interpretation,
viz., that the limbs are the remnants of continuous lateral fins.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span>&mdash;Shoulder-girdle of <i>Polypterus bichir</i>. Specimen from the White Nile.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"A similar view to that of Balfour was enunciated almost
synchronously by Thacher and a little later by Mivart&mdash;in each
case based on anatomical investigation of Selachians&mdash;mainly
relating to the remarkable similarity of the skeletal arrangements
in the paired and unpaired fins."</p>

<p>A third theory is suggested by Mr. J. Graham Kerr (<i>Cambridge
Philos. Trans.</i>, 1899), who has recently given a summary
of the theories on this subject. Mr. Kerr agrees with Gegenbaur
as to the primitive nature of the archipterygium, but believes
that it is derived, not from the gill-septum, but from an external
gill. Such a gill is well developed in the young of all the living
sharks, Dipnoans and Crossopterygians, and in the latter types
of fishes it has a form analogous to that of the archipterygium,
although without bony or cartilaginous axis.</p>

<p>We may now take up the evidence in regard to each of the
different theories, using in part the language of Kerr, the para<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>graphs
in quotation-marks being taken from his paper. We
may first consider Balfour's theory of the lateral fold.</p>

<p><b>Balfour's Theory of the Lateral Fold.</b>&mdash;"The evidence in
regard to this view may be classed under three heads, as ontogenetic,
comparative anatomical, and paleontological. The
ultimate fact on which it was founded was Balfour's discovery
that in certain Elasmobranch embryos, but especially in <i>Torpedo</i>
(<i>Narcobatus</i>), the fin rudiments were, at an early stage,
connected by a ridge of epiblast. I am not able to make out
what were the other forms in which Balfour found this ridge,
but subsequent research, in particular by Mollier, a supporter
of the lateral-fold view, is to the effect that it does not occur
in such ordinary sharks as <i>Pristiurus</i> and <i>Mustelus</i>, while it is
to be gathered from Balfour himself that it does not occur
in <i>Scyllium</i> (<i>Scyliorhinus</i>).</p>

<p>"It appears to me that the knowledge we have now that
the longitudinal ridge is confined to the rays and absent in the
less highly specialized sharks
greatly diminishes its security
as a basis on which to rest a
theory. In the rays, in correlation
with their peculiar
mode of life, the paired fins
have undergone (in secondary
development) enormous extension
along the sides of
the body, and their continuity
in the embryo may well
be a mere foreshadowing of
this.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="600" height="540" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span>&mdash;Arm of a frog.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"An apparently powerful support from the side of embryology
came in Dohrn and Rabl's discoveries that in <i>Pristiurus</i>
all the interpterygial myotomes produce muscle-buds. This,
however, was explained away by the Gegenbaur school as being
merely evidence of the backward migration of the hind limb&mdash;successive
myotomes being taken up and left behind again as
the limb moved farther back. As either explanation seems
an adequate one, I do not think we can lay stress upon this
body of facts as supporting either one view or the other. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
facts of the development of the skeleton cannot be said to
support the fold view; according to it we should expect to find
a series of metameric supporting rays produced which later on
become fused at their bases. Instead of this we find a <i>longitudinal</i>
bar of cartilage developing quite continuously, the rays
forming as projections from its outer side.</p>

<p>"The most important evidence for the fold view from the
side of comparative anatomy is afforded by (1) the fact that
the limb derives its nerve supply from a large number of spinal
nerves, and (2) the extraordinary resemblance met with between
the skeletal arrangements of paired and unpaired fins.
The believers in the branchial arch hypothesis have disposed of
the first of these in the same way as they did the occurrence of
interpterygial myotomes, by looking on the nerves received from
regions of the spinal cord anterior to the attachment of the limb
as forming a kind of trail marking the backward migration of
the limb.</p>

<p>"The similarity in the skeleton is indeed most striking,
though its weight as evidence has been recently greatly diminished
by the knowledge that the apparently metameric segmentation
of the skeletal and muscular tissues of the paired fins
is quite secondary and does not at all agree with the metamery
of the trunk. What resemblance there is may well be of
a homoplastic character when we take into account the similarity
in function of the median and unpaired fins, especially in
such forms as <i>Raja</i>, where the anatomical resemblances are
especially striking. There is a surprising dearth of paleontological
evidence in favor of this view."</p>

<p>The objection to the first view is its precarious foundation.
Such lateral folds are found only in certain rays, in which they
may be developed as a secondary modification in connection
with the peculiar form of these fishes. Professor Kerr observes
that this theory must be looked upon and judged: "Just as any
other view at the present time regarding the nature of the
vertebrate limb, rather as a speculation, brilliant and suggestive
though it be, than as a logically constructed theory of the
now known facts. It is, I think, on this account allowable to
apply to it a test of a character which is admittedly very apt to
mislead, that of 'common sense.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"If there is any soundness in zoological speculation at all, I
think it must be admitted that the more primitive vertebrates
were creatures possessing a notochordal axial skeleton near the
dorsal side, with the main nervous axis above it, the main
viscera below it, and the great mass of muscle lying in myotomes
along its sides. Now such a creature is well adapted to movements
of the character of lateral flexure, and not at all for
movements in the sagittal plane&mdash;which would be not only
difficult to achieve, but would tend to alternately compress and
extend its spinal cord and its viscera. Such a creature would
swim through the water as does a Cyclostome, or a <i>Lepidosiren</i>,
or any other elongated vertebrate without special swimming
organs. Swimming like this, specialization for more and more
rapid movement would mean flattening of the tail region and
is extension into an at first not separately mobile median tail-fold.
It is extremely difficult to my mind to suppose that a
new purely <i>swimming</i> arrangement should have arisen involving
up-and-down movement, and which, at its first beginnings,
while useless as a swimming organ itself, must greatly detract
from the efficiency of that which already existed."</p>

<p><b>Objections to Gegenbaur's Theory.</b>&mdash;We now return to the
Gegenbaur view&mdash;that the limb is a modified gill-septum.</p>

<p>"Resting on Gegenbaur's discovery already mentioned, that
the gill-rays in certain cases assume an arrangement showing
great similarity to that of the skeletal elements of the archipterygium,
it has, so far as I am aware, up to the present time
received no direct support whatever of a nature comparable
with that found for the rival view in the fact that, in certain
forms at all events, the limbs actually do arise in the individual
in the way that the theory holds they did in phylogeny. No
one has produced either a form in which a gill-septum becomes
the limb during ontogeny, or the fossil remains of any form
which shows an intermediate condition.</p>

<p>"The portion of Gegenbaur's view which asserts that the
biserial archipterygial fin is of an extremely primitive character
is supported by a large body of anatomical facts, and is
rendered further probable by the great frequency with which
fins apparently of this character occur amongst the oldest
known fishes. On the lateral-fold view we should have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
regard these as independently evolved, which would imply that
fins of this type are of a very perfect character, and in that
case we may be indeed surprised at their so complete disappearance
in the more highly developed forms, which followed
later on."</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span>&mdash;<i>Pleuracanthus decheni</i> (Goldfuss). (After Dean.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>As to Gegenbaur's theory it is urged that no form is known
in which a gill-septum develops into a limb during the growth
of the individual. The main thesis, according to Professor
Kerr, "that the archipterygium was derived from gill-rays, is
supported only by evidence of an indirect character. Gegenbaur
in his very first suggestion of his theory pointed out, as a
great difficulty in the way of its acceptance, the position of the
limbs, especially of the pelvic limbs, in a position far removed
from that of the branchial arches. This difficulty has been
entirely removed by the brilliant work of Gegenbaur's followers,
who have shown from the facts of comparative anatomy and
embryology that the limbs, and the hind limbs especially, actually
have undergone, and in ontogeny do undergo, an extensive
backward migration. In some cases Braus has been able to
find traces of this migration as far forward as a point just
behind the branchial arches. Now, when we consider the
numbers, the enthusiasm, and the ability of Gegenbaur's disciples,
we cannot help being struck by the fact that the <i>only</i>
evidence in favor of this derivation of the limbs has been that
which tends to show that a migration of the limbs backwards
has taken place from a region somewhere near the last branchial
arch, and that they have failed utterly to discover any
intermediate steps between gill-rays and archipterygial fin.
And if for a moment we apply the test of common sense we
cannot but be impressed by the improbability of the evolution
of a gill-septum, which in all the lower forms of fishes is fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
firmly in the body-wall, and beneath its surface, into an organ
of locomotion.</p>

</div>

<p>"May I express the hope that what I have said is sufficient
to show in what a state of uncertainty our views are regarding
the morphological nature of the paired fins, and upon what an
exceedingly slender basis rest both of the two views which at
present hold the field?"</p>

<p>As to the backward migration of the ventral fins, Dr. Bashford
Dean has recently brought forward evidence from the
embryo of a very ancient type of shark (<i>Heterodontus japonicus</i>)
that this does not actually occur in that species. On the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
hand, we have a forward migration of the pectoral fin, which
gradually takes its place in advance of the hindmost gill-arches.
The accompanying cut is from Dean's paper, "Biometric
Evidence in the Problem of the Paired Limbs of the Vertebrates"
(American Naturalist for November, 1902). Dean concludes
that in <i>Heterodontus</i> "there is no evidence that there
has ever been a migration of the fins in the Gegenbaurian sense."
"The gill region, at least in its outer part, shows no affinity
during proportional growth with the neighboring region of the
pectoral fin. In fact from an early stage onward, they are evidently
growing in opposite directions."</p>

<p><b>Kerr's Theory of Modified External Gills.</b>&mdash;"It is because
I feel that in the present state of our knowledge neither of the
two views I have mentioned has a claim to any higher rank
than that of extremely suggestive speculations that I venture
to say a few words for the third view, which is avowedly a
mere speculation.</p>

<p>"Before proceeding with it I should say that I assume the
serial homology of fore and hind limbs to be beyond dispute.
The great and deep-seated resemblances between them are such
as to my mind seem not to be adequately explicable except on
this assumption.</p>

<p>"In the Urodela (salamanders) the external gills are well-known
structures&mdash;serially arranged projections from the body-wall
near the upper ends of certain of the branchial arches.
When one considers the ontogenetic development of these
organs, from knob-like outgrowth from the outer face of the
branchial arch, covered with ectoderm and possessing a mesoblastic
core, and which frequently if not always appear before
the branchial clefts are open, one cannot but conclude that
they are morphologically projections of the outer skin and
that they have nothing whatever to do with the gill-pouches
of the gut-wall. Amongst the Urodela one such gill projects
from each of the first three branchial arches. In <i>Lepidosiren</i>
there is one on each of the branchial arches I-IV. In <i>Polypterus</i>
and <i>Calamoichthys</i> (<i>Erpetoichthys</i>) there is one on the hyoid
arch. Finally, in many Urodelan larv&aelig; we have present at
the same time as the external gills a pair of curious structures
called balancers. At an early stage of my work on <i>Lepidosiren</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
while looking over other vertebrate embryos and larv&aelig; for purposes
of comparison, my attention was arrested by these structures,
and further examinations, by section or otherwise, convinced
me that there were serial homologues of the external gills, situated
on the mandibular arch. On then looking up the literature,
I found that I was by no means first in this view. Rusconi
had long ago noticed the resemblance, and in more recent times
both Orr and Maurer had been led to the same conclusion
as I had been. Three different observers having been independently
led to exactly the same conclusions, we may, I
think, fairly enough regard the view I have mentioned of the
morphological nature of the balancers as probably a correct
one.</p>

<p>"Here, then, we have a series of homologous structures projecting
from each of the series of visceral arches. They crop
up on the Crossopterygii, the Dipnoi, and the Urodela, i.e., in
three of the most archaic of the groups of Gnathostomata. But
we may put it in another way. The groups in which they do
not occur are those whose young possess a very large yolk-sac
(or which are admittedly derived from such forms). Now
wherever we have a large yolk-sac we have developed on its
surface a rich network of blood-vessels for purposes of nutrition.
But such a network <i>must necessarily</i> act as an extraordinarily
efficient organ of respiration, and did we not know the facts we
might venture to prophesy that in forms possessing it any other
small skin-organ of respiration would tend to disappear.</p>

<p>"No doubt these external gills are absent also in a few of
the admittedly primitive forms such as, e.g., (<i>Neo-</i>) <i>Ceratodus</i>.
But I would ask that in this connection one should bear in
mind one of the marked characteristics of external gills&mdash;their
great regenerative power. This involves their being extremely
liable to injury and consequently a source of danger to their
possessor. Their absence, therefore, in certain cases may well
have been due to natural selection. On the other hand, the
<i>presence</i> in so many lowly forms of these organs, the general
close similarity in structure that runs through them in different
forms, and the exact correspondence in their position and relations
to the body can, it seems to me, <i>only</i> be adequately explained
by looking on them as being homologous structures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
inherited from a common ancestor and consequently of great
antiquity in the vertebrate stem."</p>

<p>As to the third theory, Professor Kerr suggests tentatively
that the external gill may be the structure modified to form the
paired limbs. Of the homology of fore and hind limbs and
consequently of their like origin there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>The general gill-structures have, according to Kerr, "the
primary function of respiration. They are also, however, provided
with an elaborate muscular apparatus comprising elevators,
depressors, and adductors, and larv&aelig; possessing them may be
seen every now and then to give them a sharp backward twitch.
They are thus <i>potentially</i> motor organs. In such a Urodele as
<i>Amblystoma</i> their homologues on the mandibular arch are used
as supporting structures against a solid substratum exactly as
are the limbs of the young <i>Lepidosiren</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>&mdash;<i>Polypterus congicus</i>, a <i>Crossopterygian</i> fish from the Congo River. Young,
with external gills. (After Boulenger.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I have, therefore, to suggest that the more ancient Gnathostomata
possessed a series of potentially motor, potentially
supporting structures projecting from their visceral arches; it
was inherently extremely probable that these should be made
use of when actual supporting, and motor appendages had to be
developed in connection with clambering about a solid substratum.
If this had been so, we should look upon the limb as
a modified external gill; the limb-girdle, with Gegenbaur, as a
modified branchial arch.</p>

<p>"This theory of the vertebrate paired limb seems to me, I
confess, to be a more plausible one on the face of it than either
of the two which at present hold the field. If untrue, it is so
dangerously plausible as to surely deserve more consideration
than it appears to have had. One of the main differences between
it and the other two hypotheses is that, instead of deriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the swimming-fin from the walking and supporting limb, it goes
the other way about. That this is the safer line to take seems
to me to be shown by the consideration that a very small and
rudimentary limb could <i>only</i> be of use if provided with a fixed
<i>point d'appui</i>. Also on this view, the pentadactyle limb and
the swimming-fin would probably be evolved independently
from a simple form of limb. This would evade the great difficulties
which have beset those who have endeavored to establish
the homologies of the elements of the pentadactyle limb
with those of any type of fully formed fin."</p>

<p><b>Uncertain Conclusions.</b>&mdash;In conclusion we may say that the evidence
of embryology in this matter is inadequate, though possibly
favoring on the whole the fin-fold theory; that of morphology
is inconclusive, and probably the final answer may be given by
paleontology. If the records of the rocks were complete, they
would be decisive. At present we have to decide which is the
more primitive of two forms of pectoral fin actually known among
fossils. That of <i>Cladoselache</i> is a low, horizontal fold of skin,
with feeble rays, called by Cope <i>ptychopterygium</i>. That of
<i>Pleuracanthus</i> is a jointed paddle-shaped appendage with a
fringe of rays on either side. In the theory of Gegenbaur and
Kerr <i>Pleuracanthus</i> must be, so far as the limbs are concerned,
the form nearest the primitive limb-bearing vertebrate. In
Balfour's theory <i>Cladoselache</i> is nearest the primitive type from
which the other and with it the archipterygium of later forms
may be derived.</p>

<p>Boulenger and others question even this, believing that the
archipterygium in <i>Pleuracanthus</i> and other primitive sharks and
that in <i>Neoceratodus</i> and its Dipnoan and Crossopterygian allies
and ancestors have been derived independently, not the latter
from the former. In this view there is no real homology between
the archipterygium in the sharks possessing it and that in the
<i>Dipnoans</i> and <i>Crossopterygians</i>. In the one theory the type of
<i>Pleuracanthus</i> would be ancestral to the other sharks on the
one hand, and to Crossopterygians and all higher vertebrates
on the other. With the theory of the origin of the pectoral
from a lateral fold, <i>Pleuracanthus</i> would be merely a curious
specialized offshoot from the primitive sharks, without descendants
and without special significance in phylogeny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>As elements bearing on this decision we may note that the
tapering unspecialized diphycercal tail of <i>Pleuracanthus</i> seems
very primitive in comparison with the short heterocercal tail
of <i>Cladoselache</i>. This evidence, perhaps deceptive, is balanced
by the presence on the head of <i>Pleuracanthus</i> of a highly specialized
serrated spine, evidence of a far from primitive structure.
Certainly neither the one genus nor the other actually represents
the primitive shark. But as <i>Cladoselache</i> appears in
geological time, long before <i>Pleuracanthus</i>, <i>Cladodus</i>, or any
other shark with a jointed, archipterygial fin, the burden of
proof, according to Dean, rests with the followers of Gegenbaur.
If the remains found in the Ordovician at Ca&ntilde;on City referred
to Crossopterygians are correctly interpreted, we must regard
the shark ancestry as lost in pre-Silurian darkness, for in sharks
of some sort the Crossopterygians apparently must find their
remote ancestry.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Forms of the Tail in Fishes.</b>&mdash;In the process of development
the median or vertical fins are, as above stated, older than
the paired fins or limbs, whatever be the origin of the latter.
They arise in a dermal keel, its membranes fitting and accentuating
the undulatory motion of the body.</p>

<p>In this elementary fin-fold slender supports (actinotrichia),
the rudiments of fin-rays, appear at intervals. In those fins of
most service in the movement of the fish, the fin-rays are
strengthened, and their basal supports specialized.</p>

<p>Dean calls attention to the fact that in fishes which swim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
when adult, by an undulatory motion, the paired fins tend to
disappear, as in the eel and in all eel-like fishes, as blennies
and eel-pouts.</p>

<p>The form of the tail at the base of the caudal fin varies in
the different groups. In most primitive types, as in most
embryonic fishes, the vertebr&aelig; grow smaller to the last (diphycercal).
In others, also primitive, the end of the tail is directed
upward, and the most of the caudal fin is below it. Such a
tail is seen in most sharks, in the sturgeon, garpike, bowfin,
and in the Ganoid fishes. It is known as heterocercal, and
finally in ordinary fishes the tail becomes homocercal or fan-shaped,
although usually some trace of the heterocercal condition
is traceable, gradually growing less with the process of
development.</p>

<p>Since Professor Agassiz first recognized, in 1833, the distinction
between the heterocercal and homocercal tail, this
matter has been the subject of elaborate investigation and a
number of additional terms have been proposed, some of which
are in common use.</p>

<p>A detailed discussion of these is found in a paper by Dr. John
A. Ryder "On the Origin of Heterocercy" in the Report of
the U. S. Fish Commissioner for 1884. In this paper a dynamic
or mechanical theory of the causes of change of form is set forth,
parts of this having a hypothetical and somewhat uncertain
basis.</p>

<p>Dr. Ryder proposes the name <i>archicercal</i> to denote the cylindroidal
worm-like caudal end of the larva of fishes and amphibians
before they acquire median fin-folds. The term <i>lophocercal</i>
is proposed by Ryder for the form of caudal fin which consists of
a rayless fold of skin continuous with the skin of the tail, the
inner surfaces of this fold being more or less nearly in contact.
To the same type of tail Dr. Jeffries Wyman in 1864 gave the
name <i>protocercal</i>. This name was used for the tail of the larval
ray when it acquires median fin-folds. The term implies, what
cannot be far from true, that this form of tail is the first in
the stages of evolution of the caudal fin.</p>

<p>To the same type of tail Mr. Alexander Agassiz gave, in
1877, the name of <i>leptocardial</i>, on the supposition that it represented
the adult condition of the lancelet. In this creature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
however, rudimentary basal rays are present, a condition differing
from that of the early embryos.</p>

<p>The diphycercal tail, as usually understood, is one in which
the end of the vertebral column bears "not only hypural but
also epural intermediary pieces which support rays." The term
is used for the primitive type of tail in which the vertebr&aelig;,
lying horizontally, grow progressively smaller, as in <i>Neoceratodus</i>,
<i>Protopterus</i>, and other Dipnoans and Crossopterygians.
The term was first applied by McCoy to the tails of the Dipnoan
genera <i>Diplopterus</i> and <i>Gyroptychius</i>, and for tails of this type it
should be reserved.</p>

</div>

<p>The heterocercal tail is one in which the hindmost vertebr&aelig;
are bent upwards. The term is generally applied to those
fishes only in which this bending is considerable and is externally
evident, as in the sharks and Ganoids. The character
disappears by degrees, changing sometimes to diphycercal or
leptocercal by a process of degeneration, or in ordinary fishes
becoming <i>homocercal</i>. Dr. Ryder uses the term heterocercal
for all cases in which any up-bending of the axis takes place,
even though it involves the modification of but a single vertebra.
With this definition, the tail of salmon, herring, and
even of most bony fishes would be considered heterocercal, and
most or all of these pass through a heterocercal stage in the
course of development. The term is, however, usually restricted
to those forms in which the curving of the axis is evident without
dissection.</p>

</div>

<p>The homocercal tail is the fan-shaped or symmetrical tail
common among the Teleosts, or bony fishes. In its process
of development the individual tail is first archicercal, then
lophocercal, then diphycercal, then heterocercal, and lastly homocercal.
A similar order is indicated by the sequence of fossil
fishes in the rocks, although some forms of diphycercal tail may
be produced by degeneration of the heterocercal tail, as suggested
by Dr. Dollo and Dr. Boulenger, who divide diphycercal tails
into primitive and secondary.</p>

<p>The peculiar tapering tail of
the cod, the vertebr&aelig; growing
progressively smaller behind, is
termed <i>isocercal</i> by Professor
Cope. This form differs little
from diphycercal, except in its
supposed derivation from the
homocercal type. A similar
form is seen in eels.</p>

Trout, <i>Salmo fario</i> (Linn&aelig;us). (After
Parker and Haswell.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The term <i>leptocercal</i> has been
suggested by Gaudry, 1883,
for those tails in which the vertebral column ends in a point.
We may, perhaps, use it for all such as are attenuate, ending
in a long point or whip, as in the <i>Macrourid&aelig;</i>, or grenadiers,
the sting-rays, and in various degenerate members of almost
every large group.</p>

<p>The term <i>gephyrocercal</i> is devised by Ryder for fishes in
which the end of the vertebral axis is aborted in the adult,
leaving the caudal elements to be inserted on the end of this
axis, thus bridging over the interval between the vertical fins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
as the name (&#947;&#949;&#966;&#8059;&#961;&#959;&#962;, bridge; &#954;&#8051;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#962;, tail) is intended to
indicate. Such a tail has been recognized in four genera only,
<i>Mola</i>, <i>Ranzania</i>, <i>Fierasfer</i>, and <i>Echiodon</i>, the head-fishes and
the pearl-fishes.</p>

<p>The part of the body of the fish which lies behind the vent
is known as the urosome. The urostyle is the name given
to a modified bony structure, originally the end of the notochord,
turned upward in most fishes. The term <i>opisthure</i>
is suggested by Ryder for the
exserted tip of the vertebral
column, which in some larv&aelig;
(<i>Lepisosteus</i>) and in some adult
fishes (<i>Fistularia</i>, <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i>) projects
beyond the caudal fin. The
urosome, or posterior part of the
body, must be regarded as a product
of evolution and specialization,
its function being largely
that of locomotion. In the theoretically
primitive fish there is no
urosome, the alimentary canal, as
in the worm, beginning at one end
of the body and terminating at
the other.</p>

<p><b>Homologies of the Pectoral Limb.</b>&mdash;Dr.
Gill has made an elaborate
attempt to work out the homologies
of the bones of the pectoral
limb.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> From his thesis we take
the following:</p>

<p>"The following are assumed as premises that will be granted
by all zootomists:</p>

<p>"1. Homologies of parts are best determinable, <i>ceteris paribus</i>,
in the most nearly related forms.</p>

<p>"2. Identification should proceed from a central or determinate
point outwards.</p>

<p>"The applications of these principles are embodied in the
following conclusions:</p>

<p>"1. The forms that are best comparable and that are most
nearly related to each other are the Dipnoi, an order of fishes
at present represented by <i>Lepidosiren</i>, <i>Protopterus</i>, and <i>Ceratodus</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>and the Batrachians as represented by the <i>Ganocephala</i>,
Salamanders, and Salamander-like animals.</p>

<p>"2. The articulation of the anterior member with the shoulder-girdle
forms the most obvious and determinable point for
comparison in the representatives of the respective classes.</p>

<p><b>The Girdle in Dipnoans.</b>&mdash;"The proximal element of the anterior
limb in the Dipnoi has almost by common consent been regarded
as homologous with the <i>humerus</i> of the higher vertebrates.</p>

<p>"The humerus of Urodele Batrachians, as well as the extinct
Ganocephala and Labyrinthodontia, is articulated chiefly with
the coracoid. Therefore the element of the shoulder-girdle with
which the humerus of the Dipnoi is articulated must also be
regarded as the <i>coracoid</i> (subject to the proviso hereinafter
stated), unless some specific evidence can be shown to the contrary.
No such evidence has been produced.</p>

<p>"The scapula in the Urodele and other Batrachians is entirely
or almost wholly excluded from the glenoid foramen, and above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the coracoid. Therefore the corresponding element in Dipnoi
must be the <i>scapula</i>.</p>

<p>"The other elements must be determined by their relation to
the preceding, or to those parts from or in connection with
which they originate. All those elements in <i>immediate</i> connection
with the pectoral fin and the scapula must be homologous
as a whole with the coraco-scapular plate of the Batrachians;
that is, it is infinitely more probable that they represent, as a
whole or as dismemberments therefrom, the coraco-scapular element
than that they independently originated. But the homogeneity
of that coraco-scapular element forbids the identification
of the several elements of the fish's shoulder-girdle with regions
of the Batrachian's coraco-scapular plate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span>&mdash;Clavicles of a Sea Catfish, <i>Selenaspis dowi</i> (Gill).</p></div>
</div>

<p>"And it is equally impossible to identify the fish's elements
with those of the higher reptiles or other vertebrates which have
developed from the Batrachians. The elements in the shoulder-girdles
of the distantly separated classes <i>may</i> be (to use the
terms introduced by Dr. Lankester) homoplastic, but they <i>are
not</i> homogenetic. Therefore they must be named accordingly.
The element of the Dipnoan's shoulder-girdle, continuous downward
from the scapula, and to which the coracoid is closely
applied, may be named <i>ectocoracoid</i>.</p>

<p>"Neither the scapula in Batrachians nor the cartilaginous
extension thereof, designated suprascapula, is dissevered from
the coracoid. Therefore there is an <i>a priori</i> improbability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
against the homology with the scapula of any part having a
distant and merely ligamentous connection with the humerus-bearing
element. Consequently, as an element better representing
the scapula exists, the element named scapula (by Owen,
G&uuml;nther, etc.) cannot be the homologue of the scapula of Batrachians.
On the other hand, its more intimate relations with
the skull and the mode of development indicate that it is rather
an element originating and developed in more intimate connection
with the skull. It may therefore be considered, with Parker,
as a <i>post-temporal</i>.</p>

<p>"The shoulder-girdle in the Dipnoi is connected by an azygous
differentiated cartilage, swollen backwards. It is more probable
that this is the homologue of the <i>sternum</i> of Batrachians,
and that in the latter that element has been still more differentiated
and specialized than that it should have originated
<i>de novo</i> from an independently developed nucleus."</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Girdle in Fishes Other than Dipnoans.</b>&mdash;"Proceeding
from the basis now obtained, a comparative examination of
other types of fishes successively removed by their affinities
from the Lepidosirenids may be instituted.</p>

<p>"With the humerus of the Dipnoans, the element of the
Polypterids (single at the base, but immediately divaricating
and with its limbs bordering an intervening cartilage which
supports the pectoral and its basilar ossicles) must be homologous.
But it is evident that the external elements of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
so-called carpus of the teleosteoid Ganoids are homologous
with that element in Polypterids. Therefore those elements
cannot be carpal, but must represent the humerus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="700" height="489" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span>&mdash;Shoulder-girdle of a Threadfin, <i>Polydactylus approximans</i> (Lay and
Bennett).</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The element with which the homologue of the humerus, in
Polypterids, is articulated must be homologous with the analogous
element in Dipnoans, and therefore with the <i>coracoid</i>.
The coracoid of Polypterids is also evidently homologous with
the corresponding element in the other Ganoids, and the latter
consequently must be also <i>coracoid</i>. It is equally evident,
after a detailed comparison, that the single coracoid element of
the Ganoids represents the three elements developed in the generalized
Teleosts (Cyprinids, etc.) in connection with the basis
of the pectoral fin, and, such being the case, the nomenclature
should correspond. Therefore the upper element may be named
<i>hypercoracoid</i>; the lower, <i>hypocoracoid</i>; and the transverse or
median, <i>mesocoracoid</i>.</p>

<p>"The two elements of the arch named by Parker, in <i>Lepidosiren</i>,
'supraclavicle' (scapula) and 'clavicle' (ectocoracoid) seem
to be comparable together, and as a whole, with the single
element carrying the humerus and pectoral fin in the Crossopterygians
(<i>Polypterus</i> and <i>Calamoichthys</i>) and other fishes, and
therefore not identical respectively with the 'supraclavicle'
and 'clavicle' (except in part) recognized by him in other fishes.
As this compound bone, composed of the scapula and ectocoracoid
fused together, has received no name which is not ambig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>uous
or deceptive in its homologous allusions, it may be designated
as <i>proscapula</i>.</p>

<p>"The post-temporal of the Dipnoans is evidently represented
by the analogous element in the Ganoids generally, as well as
in the typical fishes. The succeeding elements (outside those
already alluded to) appear from their relations to be developed
from or in connection with the post-temporal, and
not from the true scapular apparatus; they may therefore be
named <i>post-temporal</i>, <i>posterotemporal</i>, and <i>teleo-temporal</i>. It will
be thus seen that the determinations here adopted depend
mainly (1) on the interpretation of the homologies of the
elements with which the pectoral limbs are articulated, and
(2) on the application of the term 'coracoid.' The name
'coracoid,' originally applied to the process so called in the
human scapula and subsequently extended to the independent
element homologous with it in birds and other vertebrates, has
been more especially retained (e.g., by Parker in mammals, etc.)
for the region including the glenoid cavity. On the assumption
that this may be preferred by some zootomists, the preceding
terms have been applied. But if the name should be restricted
to the proximal element, nearest the glenoid cavity, in which
ossification commences, the name <i>paraglenal</i> given by Dug&egrave;s
to the cartilaginous glenoid region can be adopted, and the coracoid
would then be represented (in part) rather by the element
so named by Owen. That eminent anatomist, however, reached
his conclusion (only in part the same as that here adopted) by
an entirely different course of reasoning, and by a process, as
it may be called, of elimination; that is, recognizing first the
so-called 'radius' and 'ulna,' the 'humerus,' the 'scapula,'
and the 'coracoid' were successively identified from their relations
to the elements thus determined and because they were
numerically similar to the homonymous parts among higher vertebrates."</p>

THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_091.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">How</span> Fishes Breathe.</b>&mdash;The fish breathes the air which
is dissolved in water. It cannot use the oxygen which
is a component part of water, nor can it, as a rule,
make use of atmospheric air. The amount of oxygen required
for the low vegetative processes of the fish is comparatively
small. According to Dr. G&uuml;nther, a man consumes 50,000
times as much oxygen as a tench. But some fishes demand
more oxygen than others. Some, like the catfish or the loach,
will survive long out of water, while others die almost instantly
if removed from their element or if the water is
allowed to become foul. In most cases the temperature of the
blood of the fish is but little above that of the water in which
they live, but in the mackerel and other muscular fishes the
temperature of the body may be somewhat higher.</p>

<p>Some fishes which live in mud, especially in places which
become dry in summer, have special contrivances by which
they can make use of atmospheric air. In a few primitive
fishes (Dipnoans, Crossopterygians, Ganoids) the air-bladder retains
its original function of a lung. In other cases some peculiar
structure exists in connection with the gills. Such a contrivance
for holding water above the gills is seen in the climbing perch
of India (<i>Anabas scandens</i>) and other members of the group
called Labyrinthici.</p>

<p>In respiration, in fishes generally, the water is swallowed
through the mouth and allowed to pass out through the gill-openings,
thus bathing the gills. In a few of the lower types a
breathing-pore takes the place of the gill-openings.</p>

<p>The gills, or branchi&aelig;, are primarily folds of the skin
lining the branchial cavity. In most fishes they form fleshy
fringes or lamin&aelig; throughout which the capillaries are distributed.
In the embryos of sharks, skates, chim&aelig;ras, lung-fishes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and Crossopterygians external gills are developed, but in the
more specialized forms these do not appear outside the gill-cavity.
In some of the sharks, and especially the rays, a spiracle
or open foramen remains behind the eye. Through this spiracle,
leading from the outside into the cavity of the mouth, water is
drawn downwards to pass outward over the gills. The presence
of this breathing-hole permits these animals to lie on the bottom
without danger of inhaling sand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_092.jpg" width="700" height="229" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span>&mdash;Gill-basket of Lamprey. (After Dean.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Gill-structures.</b>&mdash;The three main types of gills among
fishes are the following: (<i>a</i>) the purse-shaped gills found in the
hagfishes and lampreys, known as a class as Marsipobranchs,
or purse-gills. These have a number (5 to 12) of sac-like depressions
on the side of the body, lined with gill-fringes and capillaries,
the whole supported by an elaborate branchial basket
formed of cartilage. (<i>b</i>) The plate-gills, found among the
sharks, rays, and chim&aelig;ras, thence called Elasmobranchs, or
plate-gills. In these the gill-structures are flat lamin&aelig;, attached
by one side to the gill-arches. (<i>c</i>) The fringe-gills found in
ordinary fishes, in which the gill-filaments containing the capillaries
are attached in two rows to the outer edge of each gill-arch.
The so-called tuft-gills (Lophobranchs) of the sea-horse
and pipefish are like these in structure, but the filaments are
long, while the arches are very short. In most of the higher
fishes a small accessory gill (pseudobranchia) is developed in
the skin of the inner side of the opercle.</p>

<p><b>The Air-bladder.</b>&mdash;The air-bladder, or swim-bladder, must
be classed among the organs of respiration, although in the
higher fishes its functions in this regard are rudimentary, and
in some cases it has taken collateral functions (as a hydrostatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
organ of equilibrium, or perhaps as an organ of hearing) which
have no relation to its original purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>&mdash;Weberian apparatus and air-bladder of Carp. (From G&uuml;nther, after
Weber.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The air-bladder is an internal sac possessed by many fishes,
but not by all. It lies in the dorsal part of the abdominal
cavity above the intestines and below the kidneys. In some
cases it is closely adherent to the surrounding tissues. In
others it is almost entirely free, lying almost loose in the cavity
of the body. In some cases it is enclosed in a bony capsule.
In the allies of the carp and catfish, which form the majority
of fresh-water fishes, its anterior end is connected through a
chain of modified vertebr&aelig; to the ear. Sometimes its posterior
end fits into an enlarged and hollow interh&aelig;mal bone. Sometimes,
again, a mass of muscle lies in front of it or is otherwise
attached to it. Sometimes it is divided into two or three parts
by crosswise constrictions. Sometimes it is constricted longitudinally,
and at other times it has attached to it a complication of
supplemental tubes of the same character as the air-bladder
itself. In still other cases it is divided by many internal partitions
into a cellular body, similar to the lung of the higher
vertebrates, though the cells are coarser and less intricate.
This condition is evidently more primitive than that of the
empty sac.</p>

<p>The homology of the air-bladder with the lung is evident.
This is often expressed in the phrase that the lung is a developed
air-bladder. This is by no means true. To say that the air-bladder
is a modified and degenerate lung is much nearer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
truth, although we should express the fact more exactly to say
that both air-bladder and lung are developed from a primitive
cellular breathing-sac, originally a diverticulum from the
ventral walls of the &oelig;sophagus.</p>

<p>The air-bladder varies in size as much as in form. In some
fishes it extends from the head to the tail, while in others it is
so minute as to be scarcely traceable. It often varies greatly
in closely related species. The common mackerel (<i>Scomber
scombrus</i>) has no air-bladder, while in the closely related colias
or chub mackerel (<i>Scomber japonicus</i>) the organ is very evident.
In other families, as the rockfishes (<i>Scorp&aelig;nid&aelig;</i>), genera with
and those without the air-bladder are scarcely distinguishable
externally. In general, fishes which lie on the bottom, those
which inhabit great depths, and those which swim freely in the
open sea, as sharks and mackerel, lack the air-bladder. In the
sharks, rays, and chim&aelig;ras there is no trace of an air-bladder.
In the mackerel and other bony fishes without it, it is lost in
the process of development.</p>

<p>The air-bladder is composed of two layers of membrane, the
outer one shining, silvery in color, with muscular fibres, the inner
well supplied by blood-vessels. The gas within the air-bladder
must be in most cases secreted from the blood-vessels. In river
fishes it is said to be nearly pure nitrogen. In marine fishes it
is mostly oxygen, with from 6 to 10 per cent of carbonic-acid
gas, while in the deep-sea fishes oxygen is greatly in excess.
In <i>Lopholatilus</i>, a deep-sea fish, Professor R. W. Tower finds 66
to 69 per cent of oxygen. In <i>Trigla lyra</i> Biot records 87 per
cent. In <i>Dentex dentex</i>, a shore fish of Europe, 40 per cent of
oxygen was found in the air-bladder. Fifty per cent is recorded
from the European porgy, <i>Pagrus pagrus</i>. In a fish dying from
suffocation the amount of carbonic-acid gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) is greatly
increased, amounting, according to recent researches of Professor
Tower on the weak-fish, <i>Cynoscion regalis</i>, to 24 to 29
per cent. This shows conclusively that the air-bladder is to
some degree a reservoir of oxygen secreted from the blood, to
which channel it may return through a kind of respiration.</p>

<p>The other functions of the air-bladder have been subject to
much question and are still far from understood. The following
summary of the various views in this regard we copy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
from Professor Tower's paper on "The Gas in the Swim-bladder
of Fishes":</p>

<p>"The function of the swim-bladder of fishes has attracted
the attention of scientists for many centuries. The r&ocirc;le that
this structure plays in the life of the animal has been interpreted
in almost as many ways as there have been investigators,
and even now there is apparently much doubt as to the true
functions of the swim-bladder. Consequently any additional
data concerning this organ are of immediate scientific value.</p>

<p>"Aristotle, writing about the noises made by fishes, states
that 'some produce it by rubbing the gill-arches ...; others
by means of the air-bladder. Each of these fishes contains air,
by rubbing and moving of which the noise is produced.' The
bladder is thus considered a sound-producing organ, and it is
probable that he arrived at this result by his own investigations.</p>

<p>"Borelli (De Motu Animalium, 1680) attributed to the air-bladder
a hydrostatic function which enabled the fish to rise
and fall in the water by simply distending or compressing the
air-bladder. This hypothesis, which gives to the fish a volitional
control over the air-bladder&mdash;it being able to compress or distend
the bladder at pleasure&mdash;has prevailed, to a greater or less
degree, from the time of Borelli to the present. To my knowledge,
however, there are no investigations which warrant such
a theory, while, on the other hand, there are many facts, as
shown by Moreau's experiment, which distinctly contradict this
belief. Delaroche (Annales du Mus. d'Hist. Nat., tome XIV, 1807-1809)
decidedly opposed the ideas of Borelli, and yet advanced
an hypothesis similar to it in many respects. Like Borelli, he
said that the fish could compress or dilate the bladder by means
of certain muscles, but this was to enable the fish to keep the
same specific gravity as the surrounding medium, and thus be
able to remain at any desired depth (and not to rise or sink).
This was also disproved later by Moreau. Delaroche proved
that there existed a constant exchange between the air in the
air-bladder and the air in the blood, although he did not consider
the swim-bladder an organ of respiration.</p>

<p>"Biot (1807), Proven&ccedil;al and Humboldt (1809), and others
made chemical analyses of the gas in the swim-bladder, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
found 1 to 5 per cent of CO<sub>2</sub>, 1 to 87 per cent of O<sub>2</sub>, and the
remainder nitrogen. The most remarkable fact discovered
about this mixture was that it frequently consisted almost
entirely of oxygen, the per cent of oxygen increasing with the
depth of the water inhabited by the fish. The reasons for this
phenomenon have never been satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p>"In 1820 Weber described a series of paired ossicles which
he erroneously called stapes, malleus, and incus, and which connected
the air-bladder in certain fishes with a part of the ear&mdash;the
atrium sinus imparis. Weber considered the swim-bladder
to be an organ by which sounds striking the body from the
outside are intensified, and these sounds are then transmitted
to the ear by means of the ossicles. The entire apparatus
would thus function as an organ of hearing. Weber's views
remained practically uncontested for half a century, but recently
much has been written both for and against this theory.
Whatever the virtues of the case may be, there is certainly an
inviting field for further physiological investigations regarding
this subject, and more especially on the phenomena of hearing
in fishes.</p>

<p>"Twenty years later Johannes M&uuml;ller described, in certain
Siluroid fishes, a mechanism, the so-called 'elastic-spring' apparatus,
attached to the anterior portion of the air-bladder,
which served to aid the fish in rising and sinking in the water
according as the muscles of this apparatus were relaxed or contracted
to a greater or lesser degree. This interpretation of the
function of the 'elastic-spring' mechanism was shown by
S&ouml;rensen to be untenable. M&uuml;ller also stated that in some fish,
at least, there was an exchange of gas between blood and air-bladder&mdash;the
latter having a respiratory function&mdash;and regarded
the gas in the air-bladder as the result of active secretion. In
<i>Malapterurus</i> (<i>Torpedo electricus</i>) he stated that it is a sound-producing
organ.</p>

<p>"Hasse, in 1873, published the results of his investigations
on the functions of the ossicles of Weber, stating that their
action was that of a manometer, acquainting the animal with
the degree of pressure that is exerted by the gases in the air-bladder
against its walls. This pressure necessarily varies with
the different depths of water which the fish occupies. Hasse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
did not agree with Weber that the ear is affected by the movements
of these ossicles.</p>

<p>"One year later Dufosse described in some fishes an air-bladder
provided with extrinsic muscles by whose vibration sound
was produced, the sound being intensified by the air-bladder,
which acted as a resonator. He also believed that certain
species produced a noise by forcing the gas from the air-bladder
through a pneumatic duct.</p>

<p>"At about the same time Moreau published his classical work
on the functions of the air-bladder. He proved by ingenious
experiments that many of the prevailing ideas about the action
of the air-bladder were erroneous, and that this organ serves to
equilibrate the body of the fish with the water at any level.
This is not accomplished quickly, but only after sufficient time
for the air in the bladder to become adjusted to the increase or
decrease in external pressure that has taken place. The fish,
therefore, makes no use of any muscles in regulating the volume
of its air-bladder. The animal can accommodate itself only
gradually to considerable changes in depth of water, but can
live equally comfortably at different depths, provided that the
change has been gradual enough. Moreau's experiments also
convinced him that the gas is actually secreted into the air-bladder,
and that there is a constant exchange of gas between
it and the blood. In these investigations he has also noticed
that section of the sympathetic-nerve fibres supplying the walls
of the air-bladder hastens the secreting of the gas into the
empty bladder. Since then Bohr has shown that section of the
vagus nerve causes the secretion to cease. Moreau noticed in
one fish (<i>Trigla</i>) having an air-bladder supplied with muscles
that the latter served to make the air-bladder produce sound.</p>

<p>"Again, in 1885, the Weberian mechanism was brought to
our attention with a new function attributed to it by Sagemehl
who stated that this mechanism exists not for any auditory
purposes, nor to tell the fish at what level of the water it is
swimming, but to indicate to the fish the variations in the atmospheric
pressure. S&ouml;rensen tersely contrasts the views of Hasse
and Sagemehl by saying that 'Hasse considers the air-bladder
with the Weberian mechanism as a manometer; Sagemehl regards
it as a barometer.' The theory of Sagemehl has, naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
enough, met with little favor. S&ouml;rensen (1895) held that there
is but little evidence for attributing to the air-bladder the function
of a lung. It is to be remembered, however, that, according
to S&ouml;rensen's criterion no matter what exchange of gases
takes place between blood and air-bladder, it cannot be considered
an organ of respiration, 'unless its air is renewed by
mechanical respiration.'</p>

<p>"S&ouml;rensen also refutes, from anatomical and experimental
grounds, the many objections to Weber's theory of the function
of the ossicles. He would thus attribute to the air-bladder the
function of hearing; indeed in certain species the only reason
for the survival of the air-bladder is that 'the organ is still of
acoustic importance; that it acts as a resonator.' This idea,
S&ouml;rensen states, is borne out by the anatomical structure found
in <i>Misgurnus</i> and <i>Chlarias</i>, which resembles the celebrated
'Colladon resonator.' This author attributes to the air-bladder
with its 'elastic spring' and various muscular mechanisms the
production of sound as its chief function."</p>

<p><b>Origin of the Air-bladder.</b>&mdash;In the more primitive forms, and
probably in the embryos of all species, the air-bladder is joined
to the &oelig;sophagus by an air-duct. This duct is lost entirely in
the adult of all or nearly all of the thoracic and jugular fishes,
and in some of the abdominal forms. The lancelets, lampreys,
sharks, rays, and chim&aelig;ras have no air-bladder, but in the
most primitive forms of true fishes (Dipnoans and Crossopterygians),
having the air-bladder cellular or lung-like, the duct is
well developed, freely admitting the external air which the fish
may rise to the surface to swallow. In most fishes the duct
opens into the &oelig;sophagus from the dorsal side, but in the more
primitive forms it enters from the ventral side, like the windpipe
of the higher vertebrates. In some of the Dipnoans the
air-bladder divides into two parts, in further resemblance to the
true lungs.</p>

<p><b>The Origin of the Lungs.</b>&mdash;The following account of the function
of the air-bladder and of its development and decline is condensed
from an article by Mr. Charles Morris:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"If now we seek to discover the original purpose of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>organ, there is abundant reason to believe that it had nothing
to do with swimming. Certainly the great family of the sharks,
which have no bladder, are at no disadvantage in changing their
depth or position in the water. Yet if the bladder is necessary
to any fish as an aid in swimming, why not to all? And if this
were its primary purpose, how shall we explain its remarkable
variability? No animal organ with a function of essential importance
presents such extraordinary modifications in related
species and genera. In the heart, brain, and other organs there
is one shape, position, and condition of greatest efficiency, and
throughout the lower forms we find a steady advance towards
this condition. Great variation, on the other hand, usually
indicates that the organ is of little functional importance, or
that it has lost its original function. Such we conceive to be
the case with the air-bladder. The fact of its absence from some
and its presence in other fishes of closely related species goes
far to prove that it is a degenerating organ; and the same is
shown by the fact that it is useless in some species for the purpose
to which it is applied in others. That it had, at some time
in the past, a function of essential importance there can be no
question. That it exists at all is proof of this. But its modern
variations strongly indicate that it has lost this function and
is on the road towards extinction. Larval conditions show that
it had originally a pneumatic duct as one of its essential parts,
but this has in most cases disappeared. The bladder itself
has in many cases partly or wholly disappeared. Where preserved,
it seems to be through its utility for some secondary
purpose, such as an aid in swimming or in hearing. That its
evolution began very long ago there can be no question; and
the indications are that it began long ago to degenerate, through
the loss of its primitive function.</p>

<p>"What was this primitive function? In attempting to answer
this question we must first consider the air-bladder in relation
to the fish tribe as a whole. No shark or ray possesses the air-bladder.
In some few sharks, indeed, there is a diverticulum
of the pharynx which may be a rudimentary approach to the
air-bladder; but this is very questionable. The conditions of its
occurrence in the main body of modern fishes, the Teleostean, we
have already considered. But in the most ancient living orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of fishes it exists in an interesting condition. In every modern
Dipnoan, Crossopterygian, and Ganoid the air-bladder has an
effective pneumatic duct. This in the Ganoids opens into the
dorsal side of the &oelig;sophagus, but in the Dipnoans and Crossopterygians,
like the windpipe of lung-breathers, it opens into
the ventral side. In the Dipnoans, also survivors from the remote
past, the duct not only opens ventrally into the &oelig;sophagus,
but the air-bladder does duty as a lung. Externally it differs
in no particular from an air-bladder; but internally it presents
a cellular structure which nearly approaches that of the lung of
the batrachians. There are three existing representatives of
the Dipnoans. One of these, the Australian lung-fish (<i>Neoceratodus</i>)
has a single bladder, which, however, is provided with
breathing-pouches having a symmetrical lateral arrangement.
It has no pulmonary artery, but receives branches from the
<i>arteria c&oelig;liaca</i>. In the other two forms, <i>Lepidosiren</i> and <i>Protopterus</i>,
the kindred 'mudfishes' of the Amazon basin and tropical
Africa, the bladder or lung is divided into two lateral chambers,
as in the land animals, and is provided with a separate
pulmonary artery.</p>

<p>"The opinion seems to have been tacitly entertained by
physiologists that this employment of the air-bladder by the
Dipnoans as a lung is a secondary adaptation, a side issue
from its original purpose. It is more likely that this is the
original purpose, and that its degeneration is due to the disappearance
of the necessity of such a function. As regards the
gravitative employment of the bladder, the Teleostean fishes, to
which this function is confined, are of comparatively modern
origin; while the Dipnoans are surviving representatives of a
very ancient order of fishes, which flourished in the Devonian
age of geology, and in all probability breathed air then as now;
and the Crossopterygians and Ganoids, which approach them in
this particular, are similarly ancient in origin, and were the
ancestors of the Teleosteans. The natural presumption, therefore,
is that the duty which it subserved in the most ancient
fishes was its primitive function.</p>

<p>"The facts of embryology lend strong support to this hypothesis.
For the air-bladder is found to arise in a manner very
similar to the development of the lung. They each begin as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
outgrowth from the fore part of the alimentary tract, the only
difference being that the air-bladder usually rises dorsally and
the lung ventrally. The fact already cited, that the pneumatic
duct is always present in the larval form in fishes that possess
a bladder, is equally significant. All the facts go to show that the
introduction of external air into the body was a former function
of the air-bladder, and that the atrophy of the duct in many
cases, and the disappearance of the bladder in others, are results
of the loss of this function.</p>

<p>"Such an elaborate arrangement for the introduction of air
into the body could have, if we may judge from analogy, but
one purpose, that of breathing, to which purpose the muscular
and other apparatus for compressing and dilating the bladder,
now seemingly adapted to gravitative uses, may have been originally
applied. The same may be said of the great development
of blood-capillaries in the inner tunic of the bladder. These
may now be used only for the secretion of gas into its interior,
but were perhaps originally employed in the respiratory secretion
of oxygen. In fact all the circumstances mentioned&mdash;the
similarity in larval development between the bladder and lung,
the larval existence of the pneumatic duct, the arrangements for
compressing and dilating the bladder, and the capillary vessels
on its inner tunic&mdash;point to the breathing of air as its original
purpose.</p>

<p>"It is probable that the Ganoid, as well as the Dipnoan, air-bladder
is to some extent still used in breathing. The Dipnoans
have both lungs and gills, and probably breathe with the latter
in ordinary cases, but use their lungs when the inland waters in
which they live become thick and muddy, or are charged with
gases from decomposing organic matter. The Ganoid fishes to
some extent breathe the air. In <i>Polypterus</i> the air-bladder resembles
the Dipnoan lung in having lateral divisions and a ventral
connection with the &oelig;sophagus, while in <i>Lepisosteus</i> (the American
garpike) it is cellular and lung-like. This fish keeps near
the surface, and may be seen to emit air-bubbles, probably
taking in a fresh supply of air. The American bowfin, or mudfish
(<i>Amia</i>), has a bladder of the same lung-like character,
and has been seen to come to the surface, open its jaws
widely, and apparently swallow a large quantity of air. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
considers that both <i>Lepisosteus</i> and <i>Amia</i> inhale and exhale air
at somewhat regular intervals, resembling in this the salamanders
and tadpoles, 'which, as the gills shrink and the lungs increase,
come more frequently to the surface for air.'</p>

<p>"As the facts stand there is no evident line of demarcation
between the gas-containing bladders of many of the Teleosteans,
the air-containing bladders of the others and the Ganoids, and
the lung of the Dipnoans, and the indications are in favor of
their having originally had the same function, and of this being
the breathing of air.</p>

<p>"If now we ask what were the conditions of life under which
this organ was developed, and what the later conditions which
rendered it of no utility as a lung, some definite answer may be
given. The question takes us back to the Devonian and Silurian
geological periods, during which the original development of the
bladder probably took place. In this era the seas were thronged
with fishes of several classes, the Elasmobranchs among others,
followed by the Dipnoi and Crossopterygians. The sharks were
without, the Dipnoans and Crossopterygians doubtless with, an
air-bladder&mdash;a difference in organization which was most likely
due to some marked difference in their life-habits. The Elasmobranchs
were the monarchs of the seas, against whose incursions
the others put on a thick protective armor, and probably sought
the shallow shore waters, while their foes held chief possession
of the deeper waters without.</p>

<p>"We seem, then, to perceive the lung-bearing fishes, driven by
their foes into bays and estuaries, and the waters of shallow
coasts, ascending streams and dwelling in inland waters. Here
two influences probably acted on them. The waters they dwelt
in were often thick with sediment, and were doubtless in many
instances poorly aerated, rendering gill-breathing difficult. And
the land presented conditions likely to serve as a strong inducement
to fishes to venture on shore. Its plant-life was abundant,
while its only animal inhabitants seem to have been insects,
worms, and snails. There can be little doubt that the active
fish forms of that period, having no enemies to fear on the land,
and much to gain, made active efforts to obtain a share of this
vegetable and animal food. Even to-day, when they have numerous
foes to fear, many fishes seek food on the shore, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
some even climb trees for this purpose. Under the conditions
of the period mentioned there was a powerful inducement for
them to assume this habit.</p>

<p>"Such conditions must have strongly tended to induce fishes
to breathe the air, and have acted to develop an organ for this
purpose. In addition to the influences of foul or muddy water
and of visits to land may be named that of the drying-out of
pools, by which fishes are sometimes left in the moist mud till
the recurrence of rains, or are even buried in the dried mud
during the rainless season. This is the case with the modern
Dipnoi, which use their lungs under such circumstances. In
certain other fresh-water fishes, of the family Ophiocephalid&aelig;,
air is breathed while the mud continues soft enough for the fish
to come to the surface, but during the dry period the animal
remains in a torpid state. These fishes have no lungs, but
breathe the air into a simple cavity in the pharynx, whose opening
is partly closed by a fold of the mucous membrane. Other
Labyrinthici, of similar habits, possess a more developed
breathing organ. This is a cavity formed by the walls of the
pharynx, in which are thin lamin&aelig;, or plates, which undoubtedly
perform an oxygenating function. The most interesting member
of this family is <i>Anabas scandens</i>, the climbing perch. In this
fish, which not only leaves the water, but is said to climb trees,
the air-breathing organ is greatly developed. The labyrinthici,
moreover, have usually large air-bladders. As regards the occasional
breathing of air by fishes, even in species which do not
leave the water, it is quite common, particularly among fresh-water
species. Cuvier remarks that air is perhaps necessary
to every kind of fish; and that, particularly when the atmosphere
is warm, most of our lacustrine species sport on the surface for
no other purpose.</p>

<p>"It is not difficult to draw a hypothetical plan of the development
of the air-bladder as a breathing organ. In the two families
of fishes just mentioned, whose air-bladders indicate that
they once possessed the air-breathing function and have lost it,
we perceive the process of formation of an air-breathing organ
beginning over again under stress of similar circumstances. The
larval development of the air-bladder points significantly in the
same direction. In fact we have strong reason to believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
air-breathing in fishes was originally performed, as it probably
often is now, by the unchanged walls of the &oelig;sophagus. Then
these walls expanded inwardly, forming a simple cavity, partly
closed by a fold of membrane, like that of the Ophiocephalid&aelig;.
A step further reduced this membranous fold to a narrow opening,
leading to an inner pouch. As the air-breathing function
developed, the opening became a tube, and the pouch a simple
lung, with compressing muscles and capillary vessels. By a continuation
of the process the smooth-walled pouch became sacculated,
its surface being increased by folding into breathing cells.
Finally, a longitudinal constriction divided it into two lateral
pouches, such as we find in the lung of the Dipnoans. This
brings us to the verge of the lung of the amphibians, which is
but a step in advance, and from that the line of progress is unbroken
to the more intricate lung of the higher land animals.</p>

<p>"The dorsal position of the bladder and its duct would be a
difficulty in this inquiry, but for the fact that the duct is occasionally
ventral. This dorsal position may have arisen from the
upward pressure of air in the swimming fish, which would tend
to lift the original pouch. But in the case of fishes which made
frequent visits to the shore new influences must have come into
play. The effect of gravity tended to draw the organ and its
duct downward, as we find in the Crossopterygians and in all
the Dipnoans, and its increased use in breathing required a more
extended surface. Through this requirement came the pouched
and cellular lung of the Dipnoans. Of every stage of the process
here outlined examples exist, and there is great reason to believe
that the development of the lung followed the path above
pointed out.</p>

<p>"When the carboniferous era opened there may have been
many lung- and gill-breathing fishes which spent much of their
time on land, and some of which, by a gradual improvement of
their organs of locomotion, changed into batrachians. But with
the appearance of the latter, and of their successors, the reptiles,
the relations of the fish to the land radically changed. The fin,
or the simple locomotor organ, of the Dipnoans could not compete
with the leg and foot as organs of land locomotion, and the
fish tribe ceased to be lords of the land, where, instead of feeble
prey, they now found powerful foes, and were driven back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
their native habitat, the water. Nor did the change end here.
In time the waters were invaded by the reptiles, numerous swimming
forms appearing, which it is likely were abundant in the
shallower shore-line of the ocean, while they sent many representatives
far out to sea. These were actively carnivorous,
making the fish their prey, the great mass of whom were doubtless
driven into the deeper waters, beyond the reach of their air-breathing
foes.</p>

<p>"In this change of conditions we seem to perceive an adequate
cause for the loss of air-breathing habits in those fishes in which
the lung development had not far progressed. It may indeed
have been a leading influence in the development of the Teleostean
or bony fishes, as it doubtless was in the loss of its primitive
function by, and the subsequent changes of, the air-bladder.</p>

<p>"Such of the Crossopterygians and Dipnoans as survived in
their old condition had to contend with adverse circumstances.
Most of them in time vanished, while their descendants which
still exist have lost in great measure their air-breathing powers,
and the Dipnoans, in which the development of the lung had
gone too far for reversal, have degenerated into eel-like, mud-haunting
creatures, in which the organs of locomotion have
become converted into the feeble paddle-like limbs of Neoceratodus
and the filamentary appendages of the other species.</p>

<p>"As regards the presence of a large quantity of oxygen in the
bladders of deep-swimming marine fishes, it not unlikely has a
respiratory purpose, the bladder being, as suggested by Semper,
used as a reservoir for oxygen, to serve the fish when sleeping,
or when, from any cause, not actively breathing. The excess
of oxygen is not due to any like excess in the gaseous contents
of sea-water, for the percentage of oxygen decreases from the
surface downward, while that of nitrogen remains nearly unchanged.
In all cases, indeed, the bladder may preserve a share
of its old function, and act as an aid in respiration. Speaking
of this, Cuvier says: 'With regard to the presumed assistance
which the swim-bladder affords in respiration, it is a fact that
when a fish is deprived of that organ, the production of carbonic
acid by the branchi&aelig; is very trifling,' thus strongly indicating
that the bladder still plays a part in the oxygenation of
the blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Under the hypothesis here presented the process of evolution
involved may be thus summed up. Air-breathing in fishes
was originally performed by the unchanged walls of the &oelig;sophagus
perhaps at specially vascular localities. Then the wall
folded inward, and a pouch was finally formed, opening to the
air. The pouch next became constricted off, with a duct of connection.
Then the pouch became an air-bladder with respiratory
function, and finally developed into a simple lung. These
air-breathing fishes haunted the shores, their fins becoming converted
into limbs suitable for land locomotion, and in time
developed into the lung- and gill-breathing batrachia, and
these in their turn into the lung-breathing reptilia, the locomotor
organs gradually increasing in efficiency. Of these pre-batrachia
we have existing representatives in the mud-haunting
Dipnoi, with their feeble limbs. In the great majority of
the Ganoid fishes the bladder served but a minor purpose as a
breathing organ, the gills doing the bulk of the work. In the
Teleostean descendants of the Ganoids the respiratory function of
the bladder in great measure or wholly ceased, in the majority
of cases the duct closing up or disappearing, leaving the pouch
as a closed internal sac, far removed from its place of origin.
In this condition it served as an aid in swimming, perhaps as a
survival of one of its ancient uses. It gained also in certain
cases some connection with the organ of hearing. But these
were makeshift and unimportant functions, as we may gather
from the fact that many fishes found no need for them, the
bladder, in these cases, decreasing in size until too small to be of
use in swimming, and in other cases completely disappearing
after having travelled far from its point of origin. In some other
cases, above cited, the process seems to have begun again, in
modern times, in an eversion of the wall of the &oelig;sophagus for
respiratory purposes. The whole process, if I have correctly
conceived it, certainly forms a remarkable organic cycle of development
and degeneration, which perhaps has no counterpart
of similarly striking character in the whole range of organic
life."</p>

<p><b>The Heart of the Fish.</b>&mdash;The heart of the fish is simple in
structure, small in size, and usually placed far forward, just
behind the branchial cavity, and separated from the abdominal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
cavity by a sort of "diaphragm" formed of thickened peritoneum.
In certain eels the heart is remote from the head.</p>

<p>The heart consists of four parts, the sinus venosus, into which
the veins enter, the auricle or atrium, the ventricle, and the
arterial bulb at the base of the great artery which carries the
blood to the gills. Of these parts the ventricle is deepest in
color and with thickest walls. The arterial bulb varies greatly
in structure, being in the sharks, rays, Ganoids, and Dipnoans
muscular and provided with a large number of internal valves,
and contracting rhythmically like the ventricle. In the higher
fishes these structures are lost, the walls of the arterial bulb are
not contractile, and the interior is without valves, except the
pair that separate it from the ventricle.</p>

<p>In the lancelet there is no proper heart, the function of the
heart being taken by a contractile blood-vessel situated on the
ventral side of the alimentary canal. In the Dipnoans, which
are allied to the ancestors of the higher vertebrates, there is the
beginning of a division of the ventricle, and sometimes of the
auricle, into parts by a median septum. In the higher vertebrates
this septum becomes more and more specialized, separating
auricle and ventricle into right and left cavities. The
blood in the fish is not returned to the heart after purification,
but is sent directly over the body.</p>

<p><b>The Flow of Blood.</b>&mdash;The blood in fishes is thin and pale red
(colorless in the lancelet) and with elliptical blood-corpuscles.
It enters the <i>sinus venosus</i> from the head through the jugular
vein, from the kidney and body walls through the cardinal vein,
and from the liver through the hepatic veins. Hence it passes
to the auricle and ventricle, and from the ventricle through the
arterial bulb, or conus arteriosus to the ventral aorta. Thence
it flows to the gills, where it is purified. After passing through
the capillaries of the gill-filaments it is collected in paired
arteries from each pair of gills. These vessels unite to form the
dorsal aorta, which extends the length of the body just below
the back-bone. From the dorsal aorta the subclavian arteries
branch off toward the pectoral fins. From a point farther back
arise the mesenteric arteries carrying blood to the stomach, intestine,
liver, and spleen. In the tail the caudal vein carries
blood to the kidneys. These secrete impurities arising from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
waste of tissues, after which the blood again passes to the heart
through the <i>cardinal vein</i>. From the intestine the blood, charged
with nutritive materials in solution, is carried by the <i>portal vein</i>
to the liver. Here it again passes by the <i>hepatic sinus</i> to the
<i>sinus venosus</i> and the heart.</p>

<p>The details of the circulatory system vary a good deal in the
different groups, and a comparative study of the direction of
veins and arteries is instructive and interesting.</p>

<p>The movement of the blood in fishes is relatively slow, and
its temperature is raised but little above that of the surrounding
water.</p>

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_109.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> nerves of the Fish.</b>&mdash;The nervous system in the fish,
as in the higher vertebrates, consists of brain and
spinal cord with sensory, or afferent, and motor, or
efferent, nerves. As in other vertebrates, the nerve substance
is divided into gray matter and white matter, or nerve-cells and
nerve-fibres. In the fish, however, the whole nervous system is
relatively small, and the gray matter less developed than in
the higher forms. According to G&uuml;nther the brain in the pike
(<i>Esox</i>) forms but 1/1305 part of the weight of the body; in the
burbot (<i>Lota</i>) about 1/720 part.</p>

<p>The cranium in fishes is relatively small, but the brain does
not nearly fill its cavity, the space between the dura mater,
which lines the skull-cavity, and the arachnoid membrane, which
envelops the brain, being filled with a soft fluid containing
a quantity of fat.</p>

<p><b>The Brain of the Fish.</b>&mdash;It is most convenient to examine the
fish-brain, first in its higher stages of development, as seen in
the sunfish, striped bass, or perch. As seen from above the
brain of a typical fish seems to consist of five lobes, four of
them in pairs, the fifth posterior to these and placed on the
median line. The posterior lobe is the <i>cerebellum</i>, or <i>metencephalon</i>,
and it rests on the <i>medulla oblongata</i>, the posterior portion
of the brain, which is directly continuous with the spinal cord.</p>

<p>In front of the cerebellum lies the largest pair of lobes, each
of them hollow, the optic nerves being attached to the lower
surface. These are known as the <i>optic lobes</i>, or <i>mesencephalon</i>.
In front of these lie the two lobes of the cerebrum, also called
the hemispheres, or <i>prosencephalon</i>. These lobes are usually
smaller than the optic lobes and solid. In some fishes they are
crossed by a furrow, but are never corrugated as in the brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of the higher animals. In front of the cerebrum lie the two
small olfactory lobes, which receive the large olfactory nerve
from the nostrils. From its lower surface is suspended the hypophysis
or pituitary gland.</p>

</div>

<p>In most of the bony fishes the structure of the brain does
not differ materially from that seen in the perch. In the sturgeon,
however, the parts are more widely separated. In the
Dipnoans the cerebral hemispheres are united, while the optic
lobe and cerebellum are very small. In the sharks and rays the
large cerebral hemispheres are usually coalescent into one, and
the olfactory nerves dilate into large ganglia below the nostrils.
The optic lobes are smaller than the hemispheres and also coalescent.
The cerebellum is very large, and the surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
medulla oblongata is more or less modified or specialized. The
brain of the shark is relatively more highly developed than that
of the bony fishes, although in most other regards the latter
are more distinctly specialized.</p>

<p><b>The Pineal Organ.</b>&mdash;Besides the structures noted in other
fishes the epiphysis, or pineal organ, is largely developed in sharks,
and traces of it are found in most or all of the higher vertebrates.
In some of the lizards this epiphysis is largely developed, bearing
at its tip a rudimentary eye. This leaves no doubt that in
these forms it has an optic function. For this reason the structure
wherever found has been regarded as a rudimentary eye,
and the "pineal eye" has been called the "unpaired median
eye of chordate" animals.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that this eye, once possessed by all
vertebrate forms, has been gradually lost with the better de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>velopment
of the paired eyes, being best preserved in reptiles
as "an outcome of the life-habit which concealed the animal in
sand or mud, and allowed the forehead surface alone to protrude,
the median eye thus preserving its ancestral value in enabling the
animal to look directly upward and backward." This theory
receives no support from the structures seen in the fishes.</p>

<p>In none of the fishes is the epiphysis more than a nervous
enlargement, and neither in fishes nor in amphibia is there
the slightest suggestion of its connection with vision. It seems
probable, as suggested by Hertwig and maintained by Dean
that the original function of the pineal body was a nervous one
and that its connection with or development into a median
eye in lizards was a modification of a secondary character. On
consideration of the evidence, Dr. Dean concludes that "the
pineal structures of the true fishes do not tend to confirm the
theory that the epiphysis of the ancestral vertebrates was connected
with a median unpaired eye. It would appear, on the
other hand, that both in their recent and fossil forms the epiphysis
was connected in its median opening with the innervation
of the sensory canals of the head. This view seems essentially
confirmed by ontogeny. The fact that three successive pairs of
epiphyseal outgrowths have been noted in the roof of the thalamencephalon<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
appears distinctly adverse to the theory of a
median eye."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><b>The Brain of Primitive Fishes.</b>&mdash;The brain of the hagfish
differs widely from that of the higher fishes, and the homologies
of the different parts are still uncertain. The different ganglia
are all solid and are placed in pairs. It is thought that the
cerebellum is wanting in these fishes, or represented by a narrow
commissure (<i>corpus restiforme</i>) across the front of the medulla.
In the lamprey the brain is more like that of the ordinary fish.</p>

<p>In the lancelet there is no trace of brain, the band-like spinal
cord tapering toward either end.</p>

<p><b>The Spinal Cord.</b>&mdash;The spinal cord extends from the brain to
the tail, passing through the neural arches of the different vertebr&aelig;
when these are developed. In the higher fishes it is cylindrical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>and inelastic. In a few fishes (headfish, trunkfish) in
which the posterior part of the body is shortened or degenerate,
the spinal cord is much shortened, and replaced behind by
a structure called cauda equina. In the headfish it has shrunk
into "a short and conical appendage to the brain." In the
Cyclostomes and chim&aelig;ra the spinal cord is elastic and more
or less flattened or band-like, at least posteriorly.</p>

<p><b>The Nerves.</b>&mdash;The nerves of the fish correspond in general
in place and function with those of the higher animals.
They are, however, fewer in number, both large nerve-trunks
and smaller nerves being less developed than in higher
forms.</p>

<p>The <i>olfactory nerves</i>, or first pair, extend through the ethmoid
bone to the nasal cavity, which is typically a blind sac with two
roundish openings, but is subject to many variations. The <i>optic
nerves</i>, or second pair, extend from the eye to the base of the
optic lobes. In Cyclostomes these nerves run from each eye to
the lobe of its own side. In the bony fishes, or Teleostei, each
runs from the eye to the lobe of the opposite side. In the sharks,
rays, chim&aelig;ras, and Ganoids the two optic nerves are joined in
a chiasma as in the higher vertebrates.</p>

<p>Other nerves arising in the brain are the third pair, or <i>nervus
oculorum motorius</i>, and the fourth pair, <i>nervus trochlearis</i>,
both of which supply the muscles of the eye. The fifth pair,
<i>nervus trigeminus</i>, and the seventh pair, <i>nervus facialis</i>, arise
from the medulla oblongata and are very close together. Their
various branches, sensory and motor, ramify among the muscles
and sensory areas of the head. The sixth pair, <i>nervus abducens</i>,
passes also to muscles of the eye, and in sharks to the
nictitating membrane or third eyelid.</p>

<p>The eighth pair, <i>nervus acousticus</i>, leads to the ear. The
ninth pair, <i>glosso-pharyngeal</i>, passes to the tongue and pharynx,
and forms a ganglion connected with the sympathetic system.
The tenth pair, <i>nervus vagus</i>, or pneumogastric nerve, arises from
strong roots in the corpus restiforme and the lower part of the
medulla oblongata. Its nerves, motor and sensory, reach the
muscles of the gill-cavity, heart, stomach, and air-bladder, as
well as the muscular system and the skin. In fishes covered
with bony plates the skin may be nearly or quite without sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>sory
nerves. The eleventh pair, <i>nervus accessorius</i>, and twelfth
pair, <i>nervus hypoglossus</i>, are wanting in fishes.</p>

<p>The spinal nerves are subject to some special modifications,
but in the main correspond to similar structures in higher vertebrates.
The anterior root of each nerve is without ganglionic
enlargement and contains only motor elements. The posterior
or dorsal root is sensory only and widens into a ganglionic swelling
near the base.</p>

<p>A sympathetic system corresponding to that in the higher
vertebrates is found in all the Teleostei, or bony fishes, and in
the body of sharks and rays in which it is not extended to the
head.</p>

THE ORGANS OF SENSE</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_115.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Organs of Smell.</b>&mdash;The sense-organs of the fish correspond
in general to those of the higher vertebrates.
The sense of taste is, however, feeble or wanting, and
that of hearing is muffled and without power of acute discrimination,
if indeed it exists at all. According to Dr. Kingsley (Vert.
Zool., p. 75), "recent experiments tend to show that in fishes the
ears are without auditory functions and are solely organs of
equilibration."</p>

<p>The sense of smell resides in the nostrils, which have no relation
to the work of breathing. No fish breathes through its
nostrils, and only in a few of the lowest forms (hagfishes)
does the nostril pierce through the roof of the mouth. In
the bony fishes the nostril is a single cavity, on either side,
lined with delicate or fringed membrane, well provided with
blood-vessels, and with nerves from the olfactory lobe. In most
cases each nasal cavity has two external openings. These may
be simple, or the rim of the nostril may be elevated, forming a
papilla or even a long barbel. Either nostril may have a papilla
or barbel, or the two may unite in one structure with two openings
or with sieve-like openings, or in some degenerate types (<i>Tropidichthys</i>)
with no obvious openings at all, the olfactory nerves
spreading over the skin of a small papilla. The openings may be
round, slit-like, pore-like, or may have various other forms. In
certain families of bony fishes (<i>Pomacentrid&aelig;</i>, <i>Cichlid&aelig;</i>, <i>Hexagrammid&aelig;</i>),
there is but one opening to each nostril. In the sharks,
rays, and chim&aelig;ras there is also but one opening on either side
and the nostril is large and highly specialized, with valvular flaps
controlled by muscles which are said to enable them "to scent
actively as well as to smell passively."</p>

<p>In the lancelet there is a single median organ supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
be a nostril, a small depression at the front of the head, covered
by ciliated membrane. In the hagfish the single median nostril
pierces the roof of the mouth, and is strengthened by cartilaginous
rings, like those of the windpipe. In the lamprey the
single median nostril leads to a blind sac. In the <i>Barramunda</i>
(<i>Neoceratodus</i>) there are both external and internal nares, the
former being situated just within the upper lip. In all other
fishes there is a nasal sac on either side of the head. This has
usually, but not always, two openings.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the sense of smell in fishes is relatively
acute, and that the odor of their prey attracts them to
it. It is known that flesh, blood, or a decaying carcass will
attract sharks, and other predatory fish are drawn in a similar
manner. At the same time the strength of this function is yet
to be tested by experiments.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Organs of Sight.</b>&mdash;The eyes of fishes differ from those of
the higher vertebrates mainly in the spherical form of the crystalline
lens. This extreme convexity is necessary because the
lens itself is not very much denser than the fluid in which the
fishes live. The eyes vary very much in size and somewhat in
form and position. They are larger in fishes living at a moderate
depth than in shore fishes or river fishes. At great depths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
as a mile or more, where all light is lost, they may become aborted
or rudimentary, and may be covered by the skin. Often species
with very large eyes, making the most of a little light or of light
from their own luminous spots, will inhabit the same depths with
fishes having very small eyes or eyes apparently useless for seeing,
retained as vestigial structures through heredity. Fishes which
live in caves become also blind, the structures showing every
possible phase of degradation. The details of this gradual loss
of eyes, whether through reversed selection or hypothetically
through inheritance of atrophy produced by disuse, have been
given in a number of memoirs on the blind fishes of the Mississippi
Valley by Dr. Carl H. Eigenmann.</p>

<p>In some fishes the eye is raised on a short, fleshy stalk and
can be moved about at the will of the fish. It is said that the
vision of the pond-skipper, <i>Periophthalmus</i>, when hunting
insects on the mud flats of Japan or India is "quite equal to
that of a frog." It is known also that trout possess keen
eyesight, and that they show a marked preference for one sort
or another of real or artificial fly. Nevertheless the vision of
fishes in general is probably not very precise. They apparently
notice motion rather than outline, changes rather than objects,
while the extreme curvature of the crystalline lens would seem
to render them all near-sighted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="700" height="155" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span>&mdash;Four-eyed Fish, <i>Anableps dovii</i> Gill. Tehuantepec, Mexico.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the eyes of the fishes there is no lachrymal gland. True
eyelids no fishes possess; the integuments of the head pass over
the eye, becoming transparent as they cross the orbit. In some
fishes part of this integument is thickened, covering the eye fully
although still transparent. This forms the adipose eyelid characteristic
of the mullet, mackerel, and ladyfish. Many of the
sharks possess a distinct nictitating membrane or special eyelid,
moved by a set of muscles. The iris in most fishes surrounds a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
round pupil without much power of contraction. It is frequently
brightly colored, red, orange, black, blue, or green.
In fishes, like rays or flounders, which lie on the bottom, a dark
lobe covers the upper part of the pupil&mdash;a curtain to shut out
light from above. The cornea is little convex, leaving small
space for aqueous humor. In two genera of fishes, <i>Anableps</i>,
<i>Dialommus</i>, the cornea is divided by a horizontal partition into
two parts. This arrangement permits these fishes, which swim
at the surface of the water, to see both in and out of the medium.
<i>Anableps</i>, the four-eyed fish, is a fresh-water fish of tropical
America, which swims at the surface like a top-minnow, feeding
on insects. <i>Dialommus</i> is a marine blenny from the Panama
region, apparently of similar habit.</p>

</div>

<p>In one genus of deep-sea fishes, <i>Ipnops</i>, the eyes are spread
out to cover the whole upper surface of the head, being modified
as luminous areas. Whether these fishes can see at all is
not known.</p>

</div>

<p>The position of the optic nerves is described in a previous
chapter.</p>

<p>In ordinary fishes there is one eye on each side of the head,
but in the flounders, by a distortion of the cranium, both ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>pear
on the same side. This side is turned uppermost as the
fish swims in the water or when it lies on the bottom. This
distortion is a matter of development. The very young flounder
swims with its broad axis vertical in the water, and it has one
eye on either side. As soon as it rests on the bottom it begins
to lean to one side. The lower eye changes its axis and by degrees
travels across the face of the fish, part of the bony interorbital
moving with it across to the other side. In some soles it is
said to pass through the substance of the head, reappearing on
the other side. In all species which the writer has examined
the cranium is twisted, the eye moving with the bones; and the
frontal bone is divided, a new orbit being formed by this division.
In most northern flounders the eyes are on the right side in the
adult, in tropical forms more frequently on the left, these
distinctions corresponding with others in the structure of the
fish.</p>

<p>In the lowest of the fish-like forms, the lancelet, the eye is
simply a minute pigment-spot situated in the anterior wall of
the ventricle at the anterior end of the central nervous system.
In the hagfishes, which stand next highest in the series, the eye,
still incomplete, is very small and hidden by the skin and muscles.
This condition is very different from that of the blind
fishes of the higher groups, in which the eye is lost through
atrophy, because in life in caves or under rocks the function of
seeing is no longer necessary.</p>

<p><b>The Organs of Hearing.</b>&mdash;The ear of the typical fish consists
of the labyrinth only, including the vestibule and usually three
semicircular canals, these dilating into sacs which contain one
or more large, loose bones, the ear-stones or otoliths. In the
lampreys there are two semicircular canals, in the hagfish but
one. There is no external ear, no tympanum, and no Eustachian
tube. The ear-sac on each side is lodged in the skull or at the
base of the cranial cavity. It is externally surrounded by bone
or cartilage, but sometimes it lies near a fontanelle or opening in
the skull above. In some fishes it is brought into very close
connection with the anterior end of the air-bladder. The latter
organ it is thought may form part of the apparatus for hearing.
The arrangement for this purpose is especially elaborate in the
carp and the catfish families. In these fishes and their relatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
(called <i>Ostariophysi</i>) the two vestibules are joined in a median
sac (<i>sinus impar</i>) in the substance of the basioccipital. This
communicates with two cavities in the atlas, which again are
supported by two small bones, these resting on a larger one
in connection with the front of the air-bladder. The system of
bones is analogous to that found in the higher vertebrates, but it
connects with the air-bladder, not with an external tympanum.
The bones are not homologous with those of the ear of higher
animals, being processes of the anterior vertebr&aelig;. The tympanic
chain of higher vertebrates has been thought homologous
with the suspensory of the mandible.</p>

Cayuga Lake.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The otoliths, commonly two in each labyrinth, are usually
large, firm, calcareous bodies, with enamelled surface and peculiar
grooves and markings. Each species has its own form of otolith,
but they vary much in different groups of fishes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.</span>&mdash;European Lancelet, <i>Branchiostoma lanceolatum</i> (Pallas). (After
Parker and Haswell.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the Elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) and in the Dipnoans
the ear-sac is enclosed in the cartilaginous substance of the skull.
There is a small canal extending to the surface of the skull, ending
sometimes in a minute foramen. The otoliths in these fishes are
soft and chalk-like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>The lancelet shows no trace of an ear. In the cyclostomes,
hagfishes, and lampreys it forms a capsule of relatively simple
structure conspicuous in the prepared skeleton.</p>

<p>The sense of hearing in fishes cannot be very acute, and is
at the most confined to the perception of disturbances in
the water. Most movements of the fish are governed by sight
rather than by sound. It is in fact extremely doubtful whether
fishes really hear at all, in a way comparable to the auditory
sense in higher vertebrates. Recent experiments of Professor
G. H. Parker on the killifish tend to show a moderate degree
of auditory sense which grades into the sense of touch, the tubes
of the lateral line assisting in both hearing and touch. While
the killifish responds to a bass-viol string, there may be some
fishes wholly deaf.</p>

<p><b>Voices of Fishes.</b>&mdash;Some fishes make distinct noises variously
described as quivering, grunting, grating, or singing. The name
grunt is applied to species of <i>H&aelig;mulon</i> and related genera, and
fairly describes the sound these fishes make. The Spanish name
ronco or roncador (grunter or snorer) is applied to several fishes,
both sci&aelig;noid and h&aelig;muloid. The noise made by these fishes
may be produced by forcing air from part to part of the complex
air-bladder, or it may be due to grating one on another of
the large pharyngeals. The grating sounds arise, no doubt,
from the pharyngeals, while the quivering or singing sounds arise
in the air-bladder. The midshipman, <i>Porichthys notatus</i>, is often
called singing fish, from a peculiar sound it emits. These sounds
have not yet been carefully investigated.</p>

<p><b>The Sense of Taste.</b>&mdash;It is not certain that fishes possess a
sense of taste, and it is attributed to them only through their
homology with the higher animals. The tongue is without delicate
membranes or power of motion. In some fishes certain
parts of the palate or pharyngeal region are well supplied with
nerves, but no direct evidence exists that these have a function
of discrimination among foods. Fishes swallow their food very
rapidly, often whole, and mastication, when it takes place, is a
crushing or cutting process, not one likely to be affected by the
taste of the food.</p>

<p><b>The Sense of Touch.</b>&mdash;The sense of touch is better developed
among fishes. Most of them flee from contact with actively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
moving objects. Many fishes use sensitive structures as a
means of exploring the bottom or of feeling their way to their
food. The barbel or fleshy filament wherever developed is
an organ of touch. In some fishes, barbels are outgrowths
from the nostrils. In the catfish the principal barbel grows
from the rudimentary maxillary bone. In the horned dace
and gudgeon the little barbel is attached to the maxillary. In
other fishes barbels grow from the skin of the chin or snout. In
the goatfish and surmullet the two chin barbels are highly
specialized. In <i>Polymixia</i> the chin barbels are modified
<i>branchiostegals</i>. In the codfish the single beard is little developed.
In the gurnards and related forms the lower rays of the pectoral
are separate and barbel-like. Detached rays of this sort are
found in the thread-fins (<i>Polynemid&aelig;</i>), the gurnards (<i>Triglid&aelig;</i>),
and in various other fishes. Barbels or fleshy flaps are often
developed over the eyes and sometimes on the scales or the
fins.</p>

</div>

<p>The structure of the lateral line and its probable relation as
a sense-organ is discussed on page <a href="#Page_23">23</a>. It is probable that it is
associated with sense of touch, and hearing as well, the internal
ear being originally "a modified part of the lateral-line system,"
as shown by Parker,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who calls the skin the lateral line and the
ear "three generations of sense-organs."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>The sense of pain is very feeble among fishes. A trout has
been known to bite at its own eye placed on a hook, and similar
insensibility has been noted in the pike and other fishes. "The
Greenland shark, when feeding on the carcass of a whale, allows
itself to be repeatedly stabbed in the head without abandoning
its prey." (<span class="smcap">G&uuml;nther.</span>)</p>

THE ORGANS OF REPRODUCTION</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_124.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Germ-cells.</b>&mdash;In most fishes the germ-cells are produced
in large sacs, ovaries or testes, arranged symmetrically
one on either side of the posterior part of
the abdominal cavity. The sexes are generally but not always
similar externally, and may be distinguished on dissection by
the difference between the sperm-cells and the ova. The ovary
with its eggs is more yellow in color and the contained cells
appear granular. The testes are whitish or pinkish, their secretion
milk-like, and to the naked eye not granular.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

modified as an intromittent organ. Vera Cruz.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In a very few cases both organs have been found in the
same fish, as in <i>Serranus</i>, which is sometimes truly hermaphrodite.
All fishes, however, seem to be normally di&oelig;cious, the two sexes
in different individuals. Usually there are no external genital
organs, but in some species a papilla or tube is developed at the
end of the urogenital sinus. This may exist in the breeding
season only, as in the fresh-water lampreys, or it may persist
through life as in some gobies. In the Elasmobranchs, cartilaginous
claspers, attached to the ventral fins in the male, serve
as a conduit for the sperm-cells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Eggs of Fishes.</b>&mdash;The great majority of fishes are oviparous,
the eggs being fertilized after deposition. The eggs are laid
in gravel or sand or other places suitable for the species, and the
milt containing the sperm-cells of the male is discharged over or
among them in the water. A very small quantity of the sperm-fluid
may impregnate a large number of eggs. But one sperm-cell
can enter a particular egg. In a number of families the
species are ovoviviparous, the eggs being hatched in the ovary
or in a dilated part of the oviduct, the latter resembling a real
uterus. In some sharks there is a structure analogous to
the placenta of higher animals, but not of the same structure
or origin. In the case of viviparous fishes actual copulation takes
place and there is usually a modification of some organ to effect
transfer of the sperm-cells. This is the purpose of the sword-shaped
anal fin in many top-minnows (<i>P&aelig;ciliid&aelig;</i>), the fin itself
being placed in advance of its usual position. In the surf-fishes
(<i>Embiotocid&aelig;</i>) the structure of part of the anal fin is modified,
although it is not used as an intromittent organ. In the Elasmobranchs,
as already stated, large organs of cartilage (claspers)
are developed from the ventral fins.</p>

<p>In some viviparous fishes, as in the rockfishes (<i>Sebastodes</i>)
and rosefishes (<i>Sebastes</i>), the young are very minute at birth.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
In others, as the surf-fishes (<i>Embiotocid&aelig;</i>), they are relatively
large and few in number. In the viviparous sharks, which constitute
the majority of the species of living sharks, the young
are large at birth and prepared to take care of themselves.</p>

</div>

<p>The eggs of fishes vary very much in size and form. In
those sharks and rays which lay eggs the ova are deposited in
a horny egg-case, in color and texture suggesting the kelp in
which they are laid. The eggs of the bullhead sharks (<i>Heterodontus</i>)
are spirally twisted, those of the cat-sharks (<i>Scyliorhinid&aelig;</i>)
are quadrate with long filaments at the angles. Those of rays
are wheelbarrow-shaped with four "handles." One egg-case
of a ray may sometimes contain several eggs and develop
several young. The eggs of lancelets are small, but those of
the hagfishes are large, ovate, with fibres at each side, each with
a triple hook at tip. The chim&aelig;ra has also large egg-cases,
oblong in form.</p>

(After Dean.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the higher fishes the eggs are spherical, large or small
according to the species, and varying in the firmness of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
outer walls. All contain food-yolk from which the embryo in
its earlier stages is fed. The eggs of the eel (<i>Anguilla</i>) are microscopic.
According to G&uuml;nther 25,000
eggs have been counted in the herring,
155,000 in the lumpfish, 3,500,000 in
the halibut, 635,200 in the sturgeon,
and 9,344,000 in the cod. Smaller
numbers are found in fishes with
large ova. The red salmon has
about 3500 eggs, the king salmon
about 5200. Where an oviduct is
present the eggs are often poured out
in glutinous masses, as in the bass.
When, as in the salmon, there is no
oviduct, the eggs lie separate and
do not cohere together. It is only
with the latter class of fishes, those
in which the eggs remain distinct,
that artificial impregnation and
hatching is practicable. In this regard
the value of the salmon and
trout is predominant. In some fishes,
especially those of elongate form, as
the needle-fish (<i>Tylosurus</i>), the ovary of but one side is
developed.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Protection of the Young.</b>&mdash;In most fishes the parents take
no care of their eggs or young. In some catfishes (<i>Platystacus</i>)
the eggs adhere to the under surface of the female. In a kind
of pipefish (<i>Solenostomus</i>), a large pouch for retention of the eggs
is formed on the belly of the female. In the sea-horses and
pipefishes a pouch is formed in the skin, usually underneath
the tail of the male. Into this the eggs are thrust, and here the
young fishes hatch out, remaining until large enough to take
care of themselves. In certain sea catfishes (<i>Galeichthys, Conorhynchos</i>)
the male carries the eggs in his mouth, thus protecting
them from the attacks of other fishes. In numerous cases the
male constructs a rough nest, which he defends against all intruders,
against the female as well as against outside enemies.
The nest-building habit is especially developed in the stickle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>backs
(<i>Gasterosteid&aelig;</i>), a group in which the male fish, though
a pygmy in size, is very fierce in disposition.</p>

<p>In a minnow of Europe (<i>Rhodeus amarus</i>) the female is said
to deposit her eggs within the shells of river mussels.</p>

<p><b>Sexual Modification.</b>&mdash;In the relatively few cases in which
the sexes are unlike the male is usually the brighter in color
and with more highly developed fins. Blue, red, black, and
silvery-white pigment are especially characteristic of the male,
the olivaceous and mottled coloration of the female. Sometimes
the male has a larger mouth, or better developed crests, barbels,
or other appendages. In some species the pattern of coloration
in the two sexes is essentially different.</p>

<p>In various species the male develops peculiar structures not
found in the female, and often without any visible purpose. In
the chim&aelig;ra a peculiar cartilaginous hook armed with a brush
of enamelled teeth at the tip is developed on the forehead in the
male only. In the skates or true rays (<i>Raja</i>) the pectoral fin
has near its edge two rows of stout incurved spines. These the
female lacks. In the breeding season, among certain fishes, the
male sometimes becomes much brighter by the accumulation of
bright red or blue pigment accompanied by black or white pigment
cells. This is especially true in the minnows (<i>Notropis</i>), the
darters (<i>Etheostoma</i>), and other fresh-water species which
spawn in the brooks of northern regions in the spring. In the
minnows and suckers horny excrescences are also developed
on head, body, or fins, to be lost after the deposition of the
spawn.</p>

<p>In the salmon, especially those of the Pacific, the adult male
becomes greatly distorted in the spawning season, the jaws and
teeth being greatly elongated and hooked or twisted so that the
fish cannot shut its mouth. The Atlantic salmon and the trout
show also some elongation of the jaws, but not to the same
extent.</p>

<p>In those fishes which pair the relation seems not to be permanent,
nor is there anything to be called personal affection
among them so far as the writer has noticed.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that the bright colors or nuptial adornments
of the males are enhanced by sexual selection. In most
species the males deposit the sperm-cells in spawning-grounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
without much reference to the preference of the females. In
general the brightest colors are not found among viviparous
fishes. None of the groups in which the males are showily
colored, while the females are plain, belong to this class. The
brightest colors are found on the individuals most mature or
having greatest vitality.</p>

EMBRYOLOGY AND GROWTH OF FISHES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_131.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Segmentation</span> of the Egg.</b>&mdash;The egg of the fish develops
only after fertilization (amphimixis). This
process is the union of its nuclear substance with
that of the sperm-cell from the male, each cell carrying its
equal share in the function of heredity. When this process
takes place the egg is ready to begin its segmentation. The
eggs of all fishes are single cells containing more or less food-yolk.
The presence of this food-yolk affects the manner of
segmentation in general, those eggs having the least amount
of food-yolk developing most typically. The simplest of all fish
like vertebrates, the lancelet (<i>Branchiostoma</i>) has very small
eggs, and in their early development it passes through stages
that are typical for all many-celled animals. The first stage in
development is the simple splitting of the egg into two halves.
These two daughter cells next divide so that there are four cells;
each of these divides, and this division is repeated until a great
number of cells is produced. The phenomenon of repeated division
of the germ-cell is called cleavage, and this cleavage is the
first stage of development in the case of all many-celled animals.
Instead of forming a solid mass the cells arrange themselves in
such a way as to form a hollow ball, the wall being a layer one
cell thick. The included cavity is called the segmentation
cavity, and the whole structure is known as a blastula. This
stage also is common to all the many-celled animals. The
next stage is the conversion of the blastula into a double-walled
cup, known as a gastrula by the pushing in of one
side. All the cells of the blastula are very small, but those
on one side are somewhat larger than those of the other,
and here the wall first flattens and then bends in until
finally the larger cells come into contact with the smaller and
the segmentation cavity is entirely obliterated. There is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
an inner layer of cells and an outer layer, the inner layer
being known as the endoblast and the outer as the ectoblast.
The cavity of the cup thus formed is the archenteron and gives
rise primarily to the alimentary canal. This third well-marked
stage is called the gastrula stage; and it is thought to occur
either typically or in some modified form in the development
of all metazoa, or many-celled animals. In the lampreys, the
Ganoids, and the Dipnoans the eggs contain a much greater
quantity of yolk than those of the lancelet, but the segmentation
resembles that of the lancelet in that it is complete; that
is, the whole mass of the egg divides into cells. There is a great
difference, however, in the size of the cells, those at the upper
pole being much smaller than those at the lower. In <i>Petromyzon</i>
and the Dipnoans blastula and gastrula stages result, which,
though differing in some particulars from the corresponding stages
of the lancelet, may yet readily be compared with them. In
the hagfishes, sharks, rays, chim&aelig;ras, and most bony fishes there
is a large quantity of yolk, and the protoplasm, instead of being
distributed evenly throughout the egg, is for the most part accumulated
upon one side, the nucleus being within this mass of
protoplasm. When the food substance or yolk is consumed and
the little fish is able to shift for itself, it leaves the egg-envelopes
and is said to be hatched. The figures on page <a href="#Page_135">135</a> show
some of the stages by which cells are multiplied and ultimately
grouped together to form the little fish.</p>

<p><b>Post-embryonic Development.</b>&mdash;In all the fishes the development
of the embryo goes on within the egg long after the gastrula
stage is passed, and until the embryo becomes a complex body,
composed of many differing tissues and organs. Almost all the
development may take place within the egg, so that when the
young animal hatches there is necessary little more than a rapid
growth and increase of size to make it a fully developed mature
animal. This is the case with most fishes: a little fish just
hatched has most of the tissues and organs of a full-grown fish,
and is simply a small fish. But in the case of some fishes the
young hatches from the egg before it has reached such an advanced
state of development, and the young looks very different
from its parent. It must yet undergo considerable change
before it reaches the structural condition of a fully developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and fully grown fish. Thus the development of most fishes is
almost wholly embryonic development&mdash;that is, development
within the egg or in the body of the mother&mdash;while the development
of some of them is to a considerable degree post-embryonic
or larval development. There is no important difference
between embryonic and post-embryonic development. The development
is continuous from egg-cell to mature animal and,
whether inside or outside of an egg, it goes on with a degree of
regularity. While certain fishes are subject to a sort of metamorphosis,
the nature of this change is in no way to be compared
with the change in insects which undergo a complete
metamorphosis. In the insects all the organs of the body are
broken down and rebuilt in the process of change. In all fishes
a structure once formed maintains a more nearly continuous
integrity although often considerably altered in form.</p>

<p><b>General Laws of Development.</b>&mdash;The general law of development
may be briefly stated as follows: All many-celled animals
begin life as a single cell, the fertilized egg-cell; each animal
goes through a certain orderly series of developmental changes
which, accompanied by growth, leads the animal to change from
single-cell to many-celled, complex form characteristic of the
species to which the animal belongs; this development is from
simple to complex structural condition; the development is the
same for all individuals of one species. While all animals begin
development similarly, the course of development in the different
groups soon diverges, the divergence being of the nature
of a branching, like that shown in the growth of a tree. In the
free tips of the smallest branches we have represented the
various species of animals in their fully developed condition, all
standing clearly apart from each other. But in tracing back
the development of any kind of animal we soon come to a
point where it very much resembles or becomes apparently
identical with some other kind of animal, and going farther back
we find it resembling other animals in their young condition,
and so on until we come to that first stage of development, that
trunk stage where all animals are structurally alike. Any animal
at any stage in its existence differs absolutely from any
other kind of animal, in this respect: it can develop into only
its own kind. There is something inherent in each develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>ing
animal that gives it an identity of its own. Although in its
young stages it may be indistinguishable from some other species
of animal in its young stages, it is sure to come out, when fully
developed, an individual of the same kind as its parents were or
are. The young fish and the young salamander may be alike
to all appearance, but one embryo is sure to develop into a
fish, and the other into a salamander. This certainty of an
embryo to become an individual of a certain kind is called the
law of heredity. Viewed in the light of development, there
must be as great a difference between one egg and another as
between one animal and another, for the greater difference is
included in the less.</p>

<p><b>The Significance of Facts of Development.</b>&mdash;The significance
of the process of development in any species is yet far from completely
understood. It is believed that many of the various
stages in the development of an animal correspond to or repeat
the structural condition of the animal's ancestors. Naturalists
believe that all animals having a notochord at any stage in
their existence are related to each other through being descended
from a common ancestor, the first or oldest chordate or back-boned
animal. In fact it is because all these chordate animals&mdash;the
lancelets, lampreys, fishes, batrachians, the reptiles, the birds,
and the mammals&mdash;have descended from a common ancestor that
they all develop a notochord, and those most highly organized replace
this by a complete back-bone. It is believed that the descendants
of the first back-boned animal have, in the course of
many generations, branched off little by little from the original
type until there came to exist very real and obvious differences
among the back-boned animals&mdash;differences which among the living
back-boned animals are familiar to all of us. The course of
development of an individual animal is believed to be a very
rapid and evidently much condensed and changed recapitulation
of the history which the species or kind of animal to which
the developing individual belongs has passed through in the
course of its descent through a long series of gradually changing
ancestors. If this is true, then we can readily understand why
the fish and the salamander and the tortoise and bird and rabbit
are all alike in their earlier stages of development, and gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
come to differ more and more as they pass through later and
later developmental stages.</p>

<p><b>Development of the Bony Fishes.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></b> The mode of development
of bony fishes differs in many and apparently important
regards from that of their nearest kindred, the Ganoids. In
their eggs a large amount of yolk is present, and its relations
to the embryo have become widely specialized. As a rule,
the egg of a Teleost is small, perfectly spherical, and enclosed
in delicate but greatly distended membranes. The germ disc is
especially small, appearing on the surface as an almost transparent
fleck. Among the fishes whose eggs float at the surface
during development, as of many pelagic Teleosts, e.g., the
sea-bass, <i>Centropristes striatus</i>, the yolk is lighter in specific
gravity than the germ; it is of fluid-like consistency, almost
transparent. In the yolk at the upper pole of the egg an oil
globule usually occurs; this serves to lighten the relative weight
of the entire egg, and from its position must aid in keeping
this pole of the egg uppermost.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_135.jpg" width="700" height="195" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span>&mdash;Development of Sea-bass, <i>Centropristes striatus</i> (Linn&aelig;us). <i>a</i>, egg
prior to germination; <i>b</i>, germ-disk after first cleavage; <i>c</i>, germ-disk after third
cleavage; <i>d</i>, embryo just before hatching. (After H. V. Wilson.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the early segmentation of the germ the first cleavage
plane is established, and the nuclear divisions have taken place
for the second; in the latter the third cleavage has been completed.
As in other fishes these cleavages are vertical, the
third parallel to the first. A segmentation cavity occurs as a
central space between the blastomeres, as it does in the sturgeon
and garpike.</p>

<p>In stages of late segmentation the segmentation cavity is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>greatly flattened, but extends to the marginal cells of the germ-disk;
its roof consists of two tiers of blastomeres, its floor of a
thin film of the unsegmented substance of the germ; the marginal
blastomeres are continuous with both roof and floor of
the cavity, and are produced into a thin film which passes
downward, around the sides of the yolk. Later the segmentation
cavity is still further flattened; its roof is now a dome-shaped
mass of blastomeres; the marginal cells have multiplied,
and their nuclei are seen in the layer of the germ, below the
plane of the segmentation cavity. These are seen in the surface
view of the marginal cells of this stage; they are separated
by cell boundaries only at the sides; below they are continuous
in the superficial down-reaching layer of the germ. The marginal
cells shortly lose all traces of having been separate; their
nuclei, by continued division, spread into the layer of germ
flooring the segmentation cavity, and into the delicate film of
germ which now surrounds the entire yolk. Thus is formed the
<i>periblast</i> of the Teleost development, which from this point onward
is to separate the embryo from the yolk; it is clearly
the specialized inner part of the germ, which, becoming fluid-like,
loses its cell-walls, although retaining and multiplying its
nuclei. Later the periblast comes into intimate relations
with the growing embryo; it lies directly against it, and appears
to receive cell increments from it at various regions; on
the other hand, the nuclei of the periblast, from their intimate
relations with the yolk, are supposed to subserve some function
in its assimilation.</p>

<p>Aside from the question of periblast, the growth of the
blastoderm appears not unlike that of the sturgeon. From
the blastula stage to that of the early gastrula, the changes
have been but slight; the blastoderm has greatly flattened out
as its margins grow downward, leaving the segmentation cavity
apparent. The rim of the blastoderm has become thickened
as the 'germ-ring'; and immediately in front of the dorsal lip
of the blastopore its thickening marks the appearance of the
embryo. The germ-ring continues to grow downward, and
shows more prominently the outline of the embryo; this now
terminates at the head region; while on either side of this point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>spreads out tail-ward on either side the indefinite layer of outgrowing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">mesoderm. In the next stage the closure of the blastopore</span><br />
is rapidly becoming completed; in front of it stretches
the widened and elongated form of the embryo. The yolk-plug
is next replaced by periblast, the dorsal lip by the tail-mass, or
more accurately the dorsal section of the germ-rim; the c&oelig;lenteron
under the dorsal lip has here disappeared, on account of
the close approximation of the embryo to the periblast; its last
remnant, the Kupffer's vesicle, is shortly to disappear. The
germ-layers become confluent, but, unlike the sturgeon, the
flattening of the dorsal germ-ring does not permit the formation
of a neurenteric canal.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>The process of the development of the germ-layers in
Teleosts appears as an abbreviated one, although in many of
its details it is but imperfectly known. In the development of
the medullary groove, as an example, the following peculiarities
exist: the medullary region is but an insunken mass of cells
without a trace of the groove-like surface indentation. It is only
later, when becoming separate from the ectoderm, that it acquires
its rounded character; its cellular elements then group
themselves symmetrically with reference to a sagittal plane,
where later, by their dissociation, the canal of the spinal cord
is formed. The growth of the entoderm is another instance of
specialized development. In an early stage the entoderm exists
in the axial region, its thickness tapering away abruptly on
either side; its lower surface is closely apposed to the periblast;
its dorsal thickening will shortly become separate as the notochord.
In a following stage of development the entoderm is
seen to arch upward in the median line as a preliminary stage
in the formation of the cavity of the gut. Later, by the approximation
of the entoderm-cells in the median ventral line, the
condition is reached where the completed gut-cavity exists.</p>

<p>The formation of the mesoderm in Teleosts is not definitely
understood. It is usually said to arise as a process of 'delamination,'
i.e., detaching itself in a mass from the entoderm.
Its origin is, however, looked upon generally as of a specialized
and secondary character.</p>

<p>The mode of formation of the gill-slit of the Teleost does
not differ from that in other groups; an evagination of the
entoderm coming in contact with an invaginated tract of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
ectoderm fuses, and at this point an opening is later established.</p>

<p>The late embryo of the Teleost, though of rounded form,
is the more deeply implanted in the yolk-sac than that of the
sturgeon; it is transparent, allowing notochord, primitive segments,
heart, and sense-organs to be readily distinguished; at
about this stage both anus and mouth are making their appearance.</p>

<p><b>The Larval Development of Fishes.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></b>&mdash;"When the young
fish has freed itself from its egg-membranes it gives but little
suggestion of its adult form. It enters upon a larval existence,
which continues until maturity. The period of change
of form varies widely in the different groups of fishes, from
a few weeks' to longer than a year's duration; and the extent
of the changes that the larva undergoes are often surprisingly
broad, investing every organ and tissue of the body, the immature
fish passing through a series of form stages which differ one
from the other in a way strongly contrasting with the mode of
growth of amniotes; since the chick, reptile, or mammal emerges
from its embryonic membranes in nearly its adult form.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>

<p>The fish may, in general, be said to begin its existence as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>a larva as soon as it emerges from its egg-membranes. In some
instances, however, it is difficult to decide at what point the
larval stage is actually initiated: thus in sharks the excessive
amount of yolk material which has been provided for the growth
of the larva renders unnecessary the emerging from the egg at
an early stage; and the larval period is accordingly to be
traced back to stages that are still enclosed in the egg-membranes.
In all cases the larval life may be said to begin when
the following conditions have been fulfilled: the outward form
of the larva must be well defined, separating it from the mass of
yolk, its motions must be active, it must possess a continuous
vertical fin-fold passing dorsally from the head region to the
body terminal, and thence ventrally as far as the yolk region;
and the following structures, characteristic in outward appearance,
must also be established: the sense-organs&mdash;eye, ear, and
nose&mdash;mouth and anus, and one or more gill-clefts.</p>

<p>Among the different groups of fishes the larval changes are
brought about in widely different ways. These larval peculiarities
appear at first of far-reaching significance, but may
ultimately be attributed, the writer believes, to changed environmental
conditions, wherein one process may be lengthened,
another shortened. So, too, the changes from one stage to
another may occur with surprising abruptness. As a rule, it
may be said the larval stage is of longest duration in the Cyclostomes,
and thence diminished in length in sharks, lung-fishes,
Ganoids, and Teleosts; in the last-named group a very much
curtailed (i.e., precocious) larval life may often occur.</p>

</div>

<p>The metamorphoses of the newly hatched Teleost must
finally be reviewed; they are certainly the most varied and
striking of all larval fishes, and, singularly enough, appear
to be crowded into the briefest space of time; the young fish,
hatched often as early as on the fourth day, is then of the
most immature character; it is transparent, delicate, easily
injured, inactive; within a month, however, it may have assumed
almost every detail of its mature form. A form hatching three
millimeters in length may acquire the adult form before it becomes
much longer than a centimeter.</p>

<p><b>Peculiar Larval Forms.</b>&mdash;The young fish usually differs from
the adult mainly in size and proportions. The head is larger
in the young, the fins are lower, the appendages less developed,
and the body more slender in the young than in the adult. But
to most of these distinctions
there are numerous exceptions,
and in some fish there is a
change so marked as to be
fairly called a metamorphosis.
In such cases the young fish in
its first condition is properly
called a larva. The larva of
the lamprey (<i>Petromyzon</i>) is
nearly blind and toothless, with
slender head, and was long supposed
to belong to a different
genus (<i>Ammoc&oelig;tes</i>) from the
adult. The larva of sharks and rays, and also of Dipnoans
and Crossopterygians, are provided with bushy external gills,
which disappear in the process of development. In most
soft-rayed fishes the embryonic fringe which precedes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
development of the vertical fins persists for a considerable
time. In many young fishes, especially the <i>Ch&aelig;todontid&aelig;</i> and
their allies (butterfly-fishes), the young fish has the head armed
with broad plates formed by the backward extension of certain
membrane-bones. In other forms the bones of the head are
in the young provided with long spines or with serrations, which
vanish totally with age. Such a change is noticeable in the
swordfish. In this species the production of the bones of the
snout and upper jaw into a long bony sword, or weapon of offense,
takes place only with age. The young fish have jaws more
normally formed, and armed with ordinary teeth. In the headfish
(<i>Mola mola</i>) large changes take place in the course of growth,
and the young have been
taken for a different type of
fishes. Among certain soft-rayed
fishes and eels the young
is often developed in a peculiar
way, being very soft,
translucent, or band-like, and
formed of large or loosely
aggregated cells. These peculiar
organisms, long known as
leptocephali, have been shown
to be the normal young of
fishes when mature very different. In the ladyfish (<i>Albula</i>) Dr.
Gilbert has shown, by a full series of specimens, that in their
further growth these pellucid fishes shrink in size, acquiring
greater compactness of body, until finally reaching about half
their maximum length as larv&aelig;. After this, acquiring essentially
the form of the adult fish, they begin a process of regular growth.
This leptocephalous condition is thought by G&uuml;nther to be due to
arrest of growth in abnormal individuals, but this is not the case
in <i>Albula</i>, and it is probably fully normal in the conger and other
eels. In the surf-fishes the larv&aelig; have their vertical fins greatly
elevated, much higher than in the adult, while the body is much
more closely compressed. In the deal-fish (<i>Trachypterus</i>) the
form of the body and fins changes greatly with age, the body
becoming more elongate and the fins lower. The differences between
different stages of the same fish seem greater than the
differences between distinct species. In fact with this and with
other forms which change with age, almost the only test of
species is found in the count of the fin-rays. So far as known
the numbers of these structures do not change. In the moonfishes
(<i>Carangid&aelig;</i>) the changes with age are often very considerable.
We copy L&uuml;tken's figure of the changes in the genus
<i>Selene</i> (fig. 113). Similar changes take place in <i>Alectis</i>, <i>Vomer</i>,
and other genera.</p>

<p><b>The Development of Flounders.</b>&mdash;In the great group of
flounders and soles (<i>Heterosomata</i>) the body is greatly compressed
and the species swim on one side or lie flat on the bottom,
with one side uppermost. This upper side is colored like
the bottom, sand-color, gray, or brown, while the lower side is
mostly white. Both eyes are brought around to the upper
side by a twisting of the cranium and a modification or division
of the frontal bones. When the young flounder is hatched it is
translucent and symmetrical, swimming vertically in the water,
with one eye on either side of the head. After a little the young
fish rests the ventral edge on the bottom. It then leans to one
side, and as its position gradually becomes horizontal the eye
on the lower side moves across with its frontal and other
bones to the other side. In most species it passes directly under
the first interneurals of the dorsal fin. These changes are best
observed in the genus <i>Platophrys</i>.</p>

<p><b>Hybridism.</b>&mdash;Hybridism is very rare among fishes in a state
of nature. Two or three peculiar forms among the snappers
(<i>Lutianus</i>) in Cuba seem fairly attributable to hybridism, the
single specimen of each showing a remarkable mixture of characters
belonging to two other common species. Hybrids may
be readily made in artificial impregnation among those fishes
with which this process is practicable. Hybrids of the different
salmon or trout usually share nearly equally the traits of the
parent species.</p>

<p><b>The Age of Fishes.</b>&mdash;The age of fishes is seldom measured
by a definite period of years. Most of them grow as long as
they live, and apparently live until they fall victims to some
stronger species. It is reputed that carp and pike have lived for
a century, but the evidence needs verification. Some fishes, as
the salmon of the Pacific (<i>Oncorhynchus</i>), have a definite period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of growth (usually four years) before spawning. After this act
all the individuals die so far as known. In Japan and China
the Ice-fish (<i>Salanx</i>), a very long, slender, transparent fish allied
to the trout, may possibly be annual in habit, all the individuals
perhaps dying in the fall to be reproduced from eggs in
the spring. But this alleged habit needs verification.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Tenacity of Life.</b>&mdash;Fishes differ greatly in tenacity of life.
In general, fishes of the deep seas die at once if brought near
the surface. This is due to the reduction of external pressure.
The internal pressure forces the stomach out through the mouth
and may burst the air-bladder and the large blood-vessels.
Marine fishes usually die very soon after being drawn out from
the sea.</p>

Some fresh-water fishes are very fragile, dying soon in the
air, often with injured air-bladder or blood-vessels. They will die
even sooner in foul water. Other fishes are extremely tenacious
of life. The mud-minnow (<i>Umbra</i>) is sometimes ploughed
up in the half-dried mud of Wisconsin prairies. The related Alaskan blackfish (<i>Dallia</i>) has been fed frozen to dogs, escaping alive
from their stomachs after being thawed out. Many of the catfishes
(<i>Silurid&aelig;</i>) will live after lying half-dried in the dust for
hours. The Dipnoan, <i>Lepidosiren</i>, lives in a ball of half-dried
mud during the arid season, and certain fishes, mostly Asiatic,
belonging to the group <i>Labyrinthici</i>, with accessory breathing
organ can long maintain themselves out of water. Among these
is the China-fish (<i>Ophiocephalus</i>), often kept alive in the Chinese
settlements in California and Hawaii. Some fishes can readily
endure prolonged hunger, while others succumb as readily as a
bird or a mammal.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Effects of Temperature on Fish.</b>&mdash;The limits of distribution
of many fishes are marked by changes in temperature. Few
marine fishes can endure any sudden or great change in this
regard, although fresh-water fishes adapt themselves to the
seasons. I have seen the cutlass-fish (<i>Trichiurus</i>) benumbed
with cold off the coast of Florida while the temperature was
still above the frost-line. Those fishes which are tenacious of
life and little sensitive to changes in climate and food are most
successfully acclimatized or domesticated. The Chinese carp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
(<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) and the Japanese goldfish (<i>Carassius auratus</i>)
have been naturalized in almost all temperate and tropical river
basins. Within the limits of clear, cold waters most of the
salmon and trout are readily transplanted. But some similar
fishes (as the grayling) are very sensitive to the least change in
conditions. Most of the catfish (<i>Silurid&aelig;</i>) will thrive in almost
any fresh waters except those which are very cold.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 116.</span>&mdash;Snake-headed China-fish, <i>Ophiocephalus barca</i>. India. (After Day.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Transportation of Fishes.</b>&mdash;The eggs of species of salmon, placed
in ice to retard their development, have been successfully transplanted
to great distances. The quinnat-salmon has been thus
transferred from California to Australia. It has been found
possible to stock rivers and lakes with desirable species, or to
restock those in which the fish-supply has been partly destroyed,
through the means of artificially impregnated eggs.</p>

<p>The method still followed is said to be the discovery of J. L.
Jacobi of Westphalia (about 1760). This process permits the
saving of nearly all the eggs produced by the individuals taken.
In a condition of nature very many of these eggs would be
left unfertilized, or be destroyed by other animals. Fishes are
readily kept in captivity in properly constructed aquaria. Unless
injured in capture or transportation, there are few species
outside the deep seas which cannot adapt themselves to life in
a well-constructed aquarium.</p>

<p><b>Reproduction of Lost Parts.</b>&mdash;Fishes have little power to reproduce
lost parts. Only the tips of fleshy structures are
thus restored after injury. Sometimes a fish in which the tail
has been bitten off will survive the injury. The wound will
heal, leaving the animal with a truncate body, fin-rays sometimes
arising from the scars.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Monstrosities among Fishes.</b>&mdash;Monstrosities are rare among
fishes in a state of nature. Two-headed young are frequently
seen at salmon-hatcheries, and other abnormally divided or
united young are not infrequent. Among domesticated species
monstrosities are not infrequent, and sometimes, as in the goldfish,
these have been perpetuated to become distinct breeds or
races. Goldfishes with telescopic eyes and fantastic fins, and
with the green coloration changed to orange, are reared in Japan,
and are often seen in other countries. The carp has also been
largely modified, the changes taking place chiefly in the scales.
Some are naked (leather-carp), others (mirror-carp) have a few
large scales arranged in series.</p>

INSTINCTS, HABITS, AND ADAPTATIONS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_152.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Habits of Fishes.</b>&mdash;The habits of fishes can hardly
be summarized in any simple mode of classification.
In the usual course of fish-life the egg is laid in the
early spring, in water shallower than that in which the parents
spend their lives. In most cases it is hatched as the water
grows warmer. The eggs of the members of the salmon and
cod families are, however, mostly hatched in cooling waters.
The young fish gathers with others of its species in little schools,
feeds on smaller fishes of other species or of its own, grows and
changes until maturity, deposits its eggs, and the cycle of life
begins again, while the old fish ultimately dies or is devoured.</p>

<p><b>Irritability of Animals.</b>&mdash;All animals, of whatever degree of
organization, show in life the quality of irritability or response
to external stimulus. Contact with external things produces
some effect on each of them, and this effect is something more
than the mere mechanical effect on the matter of which the
animal is composed. In the one-celled animals the functions
of response to external stimulus are not localized. They are
the property of any part of the protoplasm of the body. In the
higher or many-celled animals each of these functions is specialized
and localized. A certain set of cells is set apart for each
function, and each organ or series of cells is released from all
functions save its own.</p>

<p><b>Nerve-cells and Fibres.</b>&mdash;In the development of the individual
animal certain cells from the primitive external layer
or ectoblast of the embryo are set apart to preside over the relations
of the creature to its environment. These cells are highly
specialized, and while some of them are highly sensitive, others
are adapted for carrying or transmitting the stimuli received by
the sensitive cells, and still others have the function of receiv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ing
sense-impressions and of translating them into impulses of
motion. The nerve-cells are receivers of impressions. These
are gathered together in nerve-masses or ganglia, the largest
of these being known as the brain, the ganglia in general being
known as nerve-centres. The nerves are of two classes. The
one class, called sensory nerves, extends from the skin or other
organ of sensation to the nerve-centre. The nerves of the other
class, motor nerves, carry impulses to motion.</p>

<p><b>The Brain, or Sensorium.</b>&mdash;The brain or other nerve-centre
sits in darkness, surrounded by a bony protecting box. To this
main nerve-centre, or <i>sensorium</i>, come the nerves from all parts
of the body that have sensation, the external skin as well as the
special organs of sight, hearing, taste, and smell. With these
come nerves bearing sensations of pain, temperature, muscular
effort&mdash;all kinds of sensation which the brain can receive. These
nerves are the sole sources of knowledge to any animal organism.
Whatever idea its brain may contain must be built up through
these nerve-impressions. The aggregate of these impressions
constitute the world as the organism knows it. All sensation is
related to action. If an organism is not to act, it cannot feel,
and the intensity of its feeling is related to its power to act.</p>

<p><b>Reflex Action.</b>&mdash;These impressions brought to the brain by
the sensory nerves represent in some degree the facts in the
animal's environment. They teach something as to its food
or its safety. The power of locomotion is characteristic of
animals. If they move, their actions must depend on the indications
carried to the nerve-centre from the outside; if they feed
on living organisms, they must seek their food; if, as in many
cases, other living organisms prey on them, they must bestir
themselves to escape. The impulse of hunger on the one hand
and of fear on the other are elemental. The sensorium receives
an impression that food exists in a certain direction. At once
an impulse to motion is sent out from it to the muscles necessary
to move the body in that direction. In the higher animals
these movements are more rapid and more exact. This is
because organs of sense, muscles, nerve-fibres, and the nerve-cells
are all alike highly specialized. In the fish the sensation
is slow, the muscular response sluggish, but the method remains
the same. This is simple reflex action, an impulse from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
environment carried to the brain and then unconsciously reflected
back as motion. The impulse of fear is of the same
nature. Reflex action is in general unconscious, but with animals,
as with man, it shades by degrees into conscious action,
and into volition or action "done on purpose."</p>

<p><b>Instinct.</b>&mdash;Different animals show differences in method or
degree of response to external influences. Fishes will pursue
their prey, flee from a threatening motion, or disgorge sand or
gravel swallowed with their food. Such peculiarities of different
forms of life constitute the basis of instinct.</p>

<p>Instinct is automatic obedience to the demands of conditions
external to the nervous system. As these conditions vary with
each kind of animal, so must the demands vary, and from this
arises the great variety actually seen in the instincts of different
animals. As the demands of life become complex, so do the instincts.
The greater the stress of environment, the more perfect
the automatism, for impulses to safe action are necessarily adequate
to the duty they have to perform. If the instinct were
inadequate, the species would have become extinct. The fact
that its individuals persist shows that they are provided with
the instincts necessary to that end. Instinct differs from other
allied forms of response to external condition in being hereditary,
continuous from generation to generation. This sufficiently distinguishes
it from reason, but the line between instinct and reason
and other forms of reflex action cannot be sharply drawn.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to consider here the question of the origin
of instincts. Some writers regard them as "inherited habits,"
while others, with apparent justice, doubt if mere habits or
voluntary actions repeated till they become a "second nature"
ever leave a trace upon heredity. Such investigators regard
instinct as the natural survival of those methods of automatic
response which were most useful to the life of the animal, the
individual having less effective methods of reflex action perishing,
leaving no posterity.</p>

<p><b>Classification of Instincts.</b>&mdash;The instincts of fishes may be
roughly classified as to their relation to the individual into
egoistic and altruistic instincts.</p>

<p><i>Egoistic instincts</i> are those which concern chiefly the individual
animal itself. To this class belong the instincts of feed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>ing,
those of self-defense and of strife, the instincts of play, the
climatic instincts, and environmental instincts, those which direct
the animal's mode of life.</p>

<p><i>Altruistic instincts</i> are those which relate to parenthood and
those which are concerned with the mass of individuals of the
same species. The latter may be called the social instincts.
In the former class, the instincts of parenthood, may be included
the instinct of courtship, reproduction, home-making, nest-building,
and care for the young. Most of these are feebly
developed among fishes.</p>

<p>The instincts of feeding are primitively simple, growing complex
through complex conditions. The fish seizes its prey by
direct motion, but the conditions of life modify this simple
action to a very great degree.</p>

<p>The instinct of self-defense is even more varied in its manifestations.
It may show itself either in the impulse to make
war on an intruder or in the desire to flee from its enemies.
Among carnivorous forms fierceness of demeanor serves at once
in attack and in defense.</p>

<p>Herbivorous fishes, as a rule, make little direct resistance
to their enemies, depending rather on swiftness of movement,
or in some cases on simple insignificance. To the latter cause
the abundance of minnows, anchovies, and other small or feeble
fishes may be attributed, for all are the prey of carnivorous
fishes, which they far exceed in number.</p>

<p>The instincts of courtship relate chiefly to the male, the
female being more or less passive. Among many fishes the
male makes himself conspicuous in the breeding season, spreading
his fins, intensifying his pigmented colors through muscular
tension, all this supposedly to attract the attention of the
female. That this purpose is actually accomplished by such
display is not, however, easily proved. In the little brooks in
spring, male minnows can be found with warts on the nose or
head, with crimson pigment on the fins, or blue pigment on the
back, or jet-black pigment all over the head, or with varied combination
of all these. Their instinct is to display all these to
the best advantage, even though the conspicuous hues lead to
their own destruction.</p>

<p>The movements of many migratory animals are mainly con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>trolled
by the impulse to reproduce. Some pelagic fishes, especially
flying fishes and fishes allied to the mackerel, swim long
distances to a region favorable for a deposition of spawn. Some
species are known only in the waters they make their breeding
homes, the individuals being scattered through the wide seas at
other times. Many fresh-water fishes, as trout, suckers, etc., forsake
the large streams in the spring, ascending the small brooks
where they can rear their young in greater safety. Still others,
known as anadromous fishes, feed and mature in the sea, but
ascend the rivers as the impulse of reproduction grows strong.
An account of these is given in a subsequent paragraph.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 118.</span>&mdash;Jaws of <i>Nemichthys avocetta</i>. Jordan and Gilbert.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Variability of Instincts.</b>&mdash;When we study instincts of animals
with care and in detail, we find that their regularity is
much less than has been supposed. There is as much variation
in regard to instinct among individuals as there is with regard
to other characters of the species. Some power of choice is
found in almost every operation of instinct. Even the most
machine-like instinct shows some degree of adaptability to new
conditions. On the other hand, in no animal does reason show
entire freedom from automatism or reflex action. "The fundamental
identity of instinct with intelligence," says Dr. Charles
O. Whitman, "is shown in their dependence upon the same
structural mechanism (the brain and nerves) and in their responsive
adaptability."</p>

<p><b>Adaptation to Environment.</b>&mdash;In general food-securing structures
are connected with the mouth, or, as in the anglers, are
hung as lures above it; spines of offense and defense, electric
organs, poison-glands, and the like are used in self-protection;
the bright nuptial colors and adornments of the breeding season
are doubtfully classed as useful in rivalry; the egg-sacs,
nests, and other structures or habits may serve to defend the
young, while skinny flaps, sand or weed-like markings, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
many other features of mimicry serve as concessions to the environment.</p>

<p>Each kind of fishes has its own ways of life, fitted to the conditions
of environment. Some species lie on the bottom, flat,
as a flounder, or prone on their lower fins, as a darter or a stone-roller.
Some swim freely in the depths, others at the surface
of the depths. Some leap out of the water from time to time,
as the mullet (<i>Mugil</i>) or the tarpon (<i>Tarpon atlanticus</i>).</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 119.</span>&mdash;Catalina Flying Fish, <i>Cypsilurus californicus</i> (Cooper). Santa Barbara.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Flight of Fishes.</b>&mdash;Some fishes called the flying-fishes sail
through the air with a grasshopper-like motion that closely imitates
true flight. The long pectoral fins, wing-like in form,
cannot, however, be flapped by the fish, the muscles serving
only to expand or fold them. These fishes live in the open sea
or open channel, swimming in large schools. The small species
fly for a few feet only, the large ones for more than an eighth
of a mile. These may rise five to twenty feet above the water.</p>

<p>The flight of one of the largest flying fishes (<i>Cypsilurus californicus</i>)
has been carefully studied by Dr. Charles H. Gilbert
and the writer. The movements of the fish in the water are
extremely rapid. The sole motive power is the action under
the water of the strong tail. No force can be acquired while
the fish is in the air. On rising from the water the movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of the tail are continued until the whole body is out of the water.
When the tail is in motion the pectorals seem in a state of rapid
vibration. This is not produced by muscular action on the
fins themselves. It is the body of the fish which vibrates, the
pectorals projecting farthest having the greatest amplitude of
movement. While the tail is in the water the ventral fins are
folded. When the action of the tail ceases the pectorals and
ventrals are spread out wide and held at rest. They are not
used as true wings, but are held out firmly, acting as parachutes,
enabling the body to skim through the air. When the fish
begins to fall the tail touches the water. As soon as it is in the
water it begins its motion, and the body with the pectorals
again begins to vibrate. The fish may, by skimming the water,
regain motion once or twice, but it finally falls into the water
with a splash. While in the air it suggests a large dragon-fly.
The motion is very swift, at first in a straight line, but is later
deflected in a curve, the direction bearing little or no relation
to that of the wind. When a vessel passes through a school
of these fishes, they spring up before it, moving in all directions,
as grasshoppers in a meadow.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Quiescent Fishes.</b>&mdash;Some fishes, as the lancelet, lie buried in
the sand all their lives. Others, as the sand-darter (<i>Ammocrypta
pellucida</i>) and the hinalea (<i>Julis gaimard</i>), bury themselves in
the sand at intervals or to escape from their enemies. Some live
in the cavities of tunicates or sponges or holothurians or corals
or oysters, often passing their whole lives inside the cavity of
one animal. Many others hide themselves in the interstices of
kelp or seaweeds. Some eels coil themselves in the crevices of
rocks or coral masses, striking at their prey like snakes. Some
sea-horses cling by their tails to gulfweed or sea-wrack. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
little fishes (<i>Gobiomorus</i>, <i>Carangus</i>, <i>Psenes</i>) cluster under the
stinging tentacles of the Portuguese man-of-war or under
ordinary jellyfishes. In the tide-pools, whether rock, coral,
or mud, in all regions multitudes of little fishes abound. As
these localities are neglected by most collectors, they have
proved of late years a most prolific source of new species.
The tide-pools of Cuba, Key West, Cape Flattery, Sitka, Unalaska,
Monterey, San Diego, Mazatlan, Hilo, Kailua and Waiah&aelig;
in Hawaii, Apia and Pago-Pago in Samoa, the present
writer has found peculiarly rich in rock-loving forms. Even
richer are the pools of the promontories of Japan, Hakodate
Head, Misaki, Awa, Izu, Waka, and Kagoshima, where a whole
new fish fauna unknown to collectors in markets and sandy
bays has been brought to light. Some of these rockfishes are
left buried in the rock weeds as the tide flows, lying quietly
until it returns. Others cling to the rocks by ventral suckers,
while still others depend for their safety on their powers of
leaping or on their quickness of their movements in the water.
Those of the latter class are often brilliantly colored, but the
others mimic closely the alg&aelig; or the rocks. Some fishes live in
the sea only, some prefer brackish-water. Some are found only
in the rivers, and a few pass more or less indiscriminately
from one kind of water to another.</p>

<p><b>Migratory Fishes.</b>&mdash;The movements of migratory fishes are
mainly controlled by the impulse of reproduction. Some pelagic
fishes, especially those of the
mackerel and flying-fish families,
swim long distances to a region
favorable for the deposition of
spawn. Others pursue for equal
distances the schools of menhaden
or other fishes which serve
as their prey. Some species
are known mainly in the waters
they make their breeding homes,
as in Cuba, Southern California,
Hawaii, or Japan, the
individuals being scattered at
other times through the wide
seas.</p>

<p><b>Anadromous Fishes.</b>&mdash;Many
fresh-water fishes, as trout and
suckers, forsake the large streams
in the spring, ascending the
small brooks where their young
can be reared in greater safety.
Still others, known as <i>anadromous</i>
fishes, feed and mature in the
sea, but ascend the rivers as the
impulse of reproduction grows
strong. Among such fishes are the salmon, shad, alewife, sturgeon,
and striped bass in American waters. The most remarkable
case of the anadromous instinct is found in the king salmon
or quinnat (<i>Oncorhynchus tschawytscha</i>) of the Pacific Coast.
This great fish spawns in November, at the age of four years
and an average weight of twenty-two pounds. In the Columbia
River it begins running with the spring freshets in March and
April. It spends the whole summer, without feeding, in the
ascent of the river. By autumn the individuals have reached
the mountain streams of Idaho, greatly changed in appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
discolored, worn, and distorted. The male is humpbacked, with
sunken scales, and greatly enlarged, hooked, bent, or twisted
jaws, with enlarged dog-like teeth. On reaching the spawning
beds, which may be a thousand miles from the sea in the
Columbia, over two thousand in the Yukon, the female deposits
her eggs in the gravel of some shallow brook. The
male covers them and scrapes the gravel over them. The female salmon does as much as the male in covering the eggs. Then both
male and female drift tail foremost helplessly down the stream;
none, so far as certainly known, ever survive the reproductive
act. The same habits are found in the five other species of
salmon in the Pacific, but in most cases the individuals do not
start so early nor run so far. The blue-back salmon or redfish,
however, does not fall far short in these regards. The salmon
of the Atlantic has a similar habit, but the distance traveled is
everywhere much less, and most of the hook-jawed males drop
down to the sea and survive to repeat the acts of reproduction.</p>

<p><i>Catadromous</i> fishes, as the true eel (<i>Anguilla</i>), reverse this

finding their usual spawning-ground in the sea.</p>

<p><b>Pugnacity of Fishes.</b>&mdash;Some fishes are very pugnacious, always
ready for a quarrel with their own kind. The sticklebacks
show this disposition, especially the males. In Hawaii the
natives take advantage of this trait to catch the Uu (<i>Myripristis
murdjan</i>), a bright crimson-colored fish found in those waters.
The species lives in crevices in lava rocks. Catching a live one,
the fishermen suspend it by a string in front of the rocks. It
remains there with spread fins and flashing scales, and the others
come out to fight it, when all are drawn to the surface by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
concealed net. Another decoy is substituted and the trick
is repeated until the showy and quarrelsome fishes are all
secured.</p>

<p>In Siam the fighting-fish (<i>Betta pugnax</i>) is widely noted. The
following account of this fish is given by Cantor:<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>"When the fish is in a state of quiet, its dull colors present
nothing remarkable; but if two be brought together, or if
one sees its own image in a looking-glass, the little creature
becomes suddenly excited, the raised fins and the whole body
shine with metallic colors of dazzling beauty, while the projected
gill membrane, waving like a black frill round the throat,
adds something of grotesqueness to the general appearance. In
this state it makes repeated darts at its real or reflected antagonist.
But both, when taken out of each other's sight, instantly
become quiet. The fishes were kept in glasses of water, fed
with larv&aelig; of mosquitoes, and had thus lived for many months.
The Siamese are as infatuated with the combats of these fish
as the Malays are with their cock-fights, and stake on the issue
considerable sums, and sometimes their own persons and families.
The license to exhibit fish-fights is farmed, and brings a
considerable annual revenue to the king of Siam. The species
abounds in the rivulets at the foot of the hills of Penang. The
inhabitants name it 'Pla-kat,' or the 'fighting-fish'; but the
kind kept especially for fighting is an artificial variety cultivated
for the purpose."</p>

<p>A related species is the equally famous tree-climber of India
(<i>Anabas scandens</i>). In 1797 Lieutenant Daldorf describes his
capture of an <i>Anabas</i>, five feet above the water, on the bark of
a palm-tree. In the effort to do this, the fish held on to the
bark by its preopercular spines, bent its tail, inserted its anal
spines, then pushing forward, repeated the operation.</p>

<p><b>Fear and Anger in Fishes.</b>&mdash;From an interesting paper by
Surgeon Francis Day<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> on Fear and Anger in Fishes we may make
the following extracts, slightly condensed and with a few slight
corrections in nomenclature. The paper is written in amplification
of another by Rev. S. J. Whitmee, describing the behavior
of aquarium fishes in Samoa.</p>

<p>The means of expression in animals adverted to by Mr.
Darwin (excluding those of the ears, which would be out of
place in fishes) are: sounds, vocally or otherwise produced; the
erection of dermal appendages under the influence of anger or
terror, which last would be analogous to the erection of scales
and fin-rays among fishes. Regarding special expressions, as
those of joy, pain, astonishment, etc., we could hardly expect
such so well marked in fishes as in some of the higher animals, in
which the play of the features often affords us an insight into
their internal emotions. Eyes<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> destitute of movable eyelids,
cheeks covered with scales, or the head enveloped in dermal
plates, can scarcely mantle into a smile or expand into a broad
grin. We possess, however, one very distinct expression in
fishes which is absent or but slightly developed in most of
the higher animals, namely, change of color. All are aware
that when a fish sickens, its brilliant colors fade, but less so
how its color may be augmented by anger, and a loss of it be
occasioned by depression, the result of being vanquished by a
foe. Some forms also emit sounds when actuated by terror,
and perhaps in times of anger; but of this last I possess no
decided proofs.</p>

<p>Similar to the expression of anger in <i>Betta</i> is that of the
three-spined stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>).<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> After a fight
between two examples, according to Couch, "a strange alteration
takes place almost immediately in the defeated party: his
gallant bearing forsakes him; his gay colors fade away; he
becomes again speckled and ugly; and he hides his disgrace
amongst his peaceable companions who occupy together that
part of the tub which their tyrants have not taken possession
of; he is, moreover, for some time the constant object of his
conqueror's persecution."</p>

<p>Fear is shown by fish in many ways. There is not an angler
unacquainted with the natural timidity of fishes, nor a keeper in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>charge of a salmon-pass, who does not know how easy it is for
poachers to deter the salmon from venturing along the path
raised expressly for his use.</p>

<p>Among the coral reefs of the Andaman Islands I found the
little <i>Chromis lepisurus</i> abundant. As soon as the water was
splashed they appeared to retire for safety to the branching coral,
where no large fish could follow them; so frightened did they
become that on an Andamanese diving from the side of the
boat, they at once sought shelter in the coral, in which they
remained until it was removed from the sea. In Burma I observed,
in 1869, that when weirs are not allowed to stretch
across the rivers (which would impede navigation), the open
side as far as the bank is studded with reeds; these, as the
water passes over them, cause vibration, and occasion a curious
sound alarming the fishes, which, crossing to the weired side of
the river, become captured.</p>

<p>Hooker, alluding to gulls, terns, wild geese, and pelicans in
the Ganges Valley, observes: "These birds congregate by the
sides of pools and beat the water with violence, so as to scare
the fish, which then become an easy prey&mdash;a fact which was, I
believe, first indicated by Pallas during his residence on the
banks of the Caspian Sea."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Fishes, under the influence of
terror, dash about with their fins expanded, and often run into
places which must destroy them. Thus droves and droves of
sardines in the east, impelled by the terror of pursuing sharks,
bonitos, and other voracious fishes, frequently throw themselves
on the shores in enormous quantities. Friar Odoric,
who visited Ceylon about 1320, says: "There are fishes in those
seas which come swimming towards the said country in such
abundance, that for a great distance into the sea nothing can
be seen but the backs of fishes, which, casting themselves on
the shore, do suffer men for the space of three days to come,
and to take as many of them as they please, and then they
return again into the sea."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Pennant tells us that the river bullhead (<i>Cottus gobio</i>) "deposits
its spawn in a hole it forms in the gravel, and quits it
with great reluctance." General Hardwicke tells how the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>gouramy (<i>Osphromenus gouramy</i>), in the Mauritius, forms a
nest amongst the herbage growing in the shallow water in the
sides of tanks. Here the parent continues to watch the place
with the greatest vigilance, driving away any interloping fish.
The amphibious walking-fish of Mysore (<i>Ophiocephalus striatus</i>)
appears to make a nest very similar to that of the gouramy, and
over it the male keeps guard; but should he be killed or captured,
the vacant post is filled by his partner. (Colonel Puckle.)
When very young the fishes keep with and are defended by
their parents, but so soon as they are sufficiently strong to
capture prey for themselves they are driven away to seek their
own subsistence. (See Fishes of India, p. 362.) But it is not
only these monogamous amphibious fishes which show an affection
for their eggs and also for their fry, but even the little
<i>Etroplus maculatus</i> has been observed to be equally fond of its
ova. "The eggs are not very numerous and are deposited in
the mud at the bottom of the stream, and, when hatched, both
parents guard the young for many days, vigorously attacking
any large fish that passes near them."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Although the proceedings of the members of the marine and
estuary genus of sea-cat (<i>Tachysurus</i>) and its allies show not quite
so distinctly signs of affection, still it must be a well-developed
instinct which induces the male to carry about the eggs in its
mouth until hatched, and to remove them in this manner when
danger is imminent. I have taken the ova just ready for the
young to come forth out of the mouth and fauces of the parent
(male) fish; and in every animal dissected there was no trace
of food in the intestinal tract.</p>

<p><b>Calling the Fishes.</b>&mdash;At many temples in India fishes are
called to receive food by means of ringing bells or musical
sounds. Carew, in Cornwall, is said to have called the gray
mullet together by making a noise like chopping with a cleaver.
Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de relates that some fishes, which had been kept in the
basins out of the Tuileries for more than a century, would come
when called by their names, and that in many parts of Germany
trout, carp, and tench are summoned to their food by
the sound of a bell. These instances are mostly due to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>fishes having learned by experience that on the hearing certain
sounds they may expect food. But Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de mentions that
some were able to distinguish their individual names; and the
same occurs in India. Lieutenant Connolly<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> remarked upon
seeing numerous fishes coming to the ghaut at Sidhnath to be
fed when called; and on "expressing our admiration of the
size of the fish, 'Wait,' said a bystander, 'until you have seen
Raghu.' The Brahmin called out his name in a peculiar tone
of voice; but he would not hear. I threw in handful after handful
of ottah (flour) with the same success, and was just leaving
the ghaut, despairing and doubting, when a loud plunge startled
me. I thought somebody had jumped off the bastion of the
ghaut into the river, but was soon undeceived by the general
shout of 'Raghu, raghu,' and by the fishes, large and small,
darting away in every direction. Raghu made two or three
plunges, but was so quick in his motions that I was unable to
guess at his species." [It may be said in relation to these stories
quoted by Dr. Day, that they probably belong to the mythology
of fishes. It is very doubtful if fishes are able to make any such
discrimination among sounds in the air.]</p>

<p><b>Sounds of Fishes.</b>&mdash;Pallegoix states that in Siam the dog's-tongue
(<i>Cynoglossus</i>) is a kind of sole; it attaches itself to the
bottom of boats, and makes a sonorous noise, which is more
musical when several are stuck to the same boat and act in
concert (vol. i. p. 193). These noises can scarcely be due to
anger or fear. Sir J. Bowring (vol. ii. p. 276) also remarks
upon having heard this fish, "which sticks to the bottoms of
the boats, and produces a sound something like that of a jew's-harp
struck slowly, though sometimes it increases in loudness,
so as to resemble the full tones and sound of an organ. My
men have pointed me out a fish about four inches long as the
author of the music."</p>

<p>Some years since, at Madras, I (Dr. Day) obtained several
specimens of a fresh-water Siluroid fish (<i>Macrones vittatus</i>) which
is termed the "fiddler" in Mysore. I touched one which was
on the wet ground, at which it appeared to become very irate,
erecting its dorsal fin, making a noise resembling the buzzing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>a bee. Having put some small carp into an aquarium containing
one of these fishes, it rushed at a small example, <i>seized it
by the middle of its back</i>, and shook it like a dog killing a rat;
at this time its barbels were stiffened out laterally like a cat's
whiskers.</p>

<p>Many fish when captured make noises, perhaps due to
terror. Thus the <i>Carangus hippos</i>, <i>Tetraodon</i>, and others grunt
like a hog. Darwin (Nat. Journ., vol. vii) remarks on a catfish
found in the Rio Paran&aacute;, and called the armado, which is remarkable
for a harsh grating noise when caught by hook and line;
this noise can be distinctly heard when the fish is beneath the
water.</p>

<p>The cuckoo-gurnard (<i>Trigla pini</i>) and the maigre (<i>Pseudosci&aelig;na
aquila</i>) utter sounds when taken out of the water; and
herrings, when the net has been drawn over them, have been
observed to do the same: "this effect has been attributed to
an escape of air from the air-bladder; but no air-bladder exists
in the <i>Cottus</i>, which makes a similar noise."</p>

<p>The lesser weaver (<i>Trachinus</i>) buries itself in the loose soil
at the bottom of the water, leaving only its head exposed, and
awaits its prey. If touched, it strikes upwards or sideways;
and Pennant says it directs its blows with as much judgment as
a fighting-cock. (Yarrell, vol. i. p. 26.) Fishermen assert that
wounds from its anterior dorsal spines are more venomous than
those caused by the spines on its gill-covers.</p>

<p>As regards fighting, I should suppose that, unless some portion
of the body is peculiarly adapted for this purpose, as the
rostrum of the swordfish, or the spine on the side of the tail
in the lancet-fishes, we must look chiefly to the armature or
covering of the jaws for weapons of offense.</p>

<p><b>Lurking Fishes.</b>&mdash;Mr. Whitmee supposes that most carnivorous
fish capture their prey by outswimming them; but to
this there are numerous exceptions; the angler or fishing-frog
(<i>Lophis piscatorius</i>), "while crouching close to the ground, by
the action of its ventral and pectoral fins stirs up the sand and
mud; hidden by the obscurity thus produced, it elevates its
anterior dorsal spines, moves them in various directions by
way of attraction as a bait, and the small fishes, approaching
either to examine or to seize them, immediately become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
prey of the fisher." (Yarrell.) In India we find a fresh-water
Siluroid (<i>Chaca lophioides</i>) which "conceals itself among
the mud, from which, by its lurid appearance and a number
of loose filamentous substances on its skin, it is scarcely
distinguishable; and with an immense open mouth it is ready
to seize any small prey that is passing along." (Ham. Buchanan.)
In March, 1868, I obtained a fine example of <i>Ichthyscopus
lebeck</i> (Fishes of India, p. 261), which I placed in
water having a bed of mud; into this it rapidly worked itself,
first depressing one side and then another, until only the top of
its head and mouth remained above the mud, whilst a constant
current was kept up through its gills. It made a noise, half
snapping and half croaking, when removed from its native element.</p>

<p>In the Royal Westminster Aquarium, says Dr. Day, is a
live example of the electric eel (<i>Electrophorus electricus</i>) which
has in its electric organs the means of showing when it is
affected by anger or terror. Some consider this curious property
is for protection against alligators: it is certainly used
against fishes for the purpose of obtaining food; but when we
remember how, when the Indians drive in horses and mules to
the waters infested by the eels, they immediately attack them,
we must admit that such cannot be for the purpose of preying
upon them, but is due to anger or terror at being disturbed.
(<span class="smcap">Day.</span>)</p>

<p><b>Carrying Eggs in the Mouth.</b>&mdash;Many catfishes (<i>Silurid&aelig;</i>) carry
their eggs in the mouth until hatched. The first and most
complete account of this habit of catfishes is that by Dr. Jeffries
Wyman, which he communicated to the Boston Society
of Natural History at its meeting on September 15, 1857. In
1859, in a paper entitled "On Some Unusual Modes of Gestation,"
Dr. Wyman published a full account of his observations
as follows, here quoted from a paper on Surinam fishes
by Evermann and Goldsborough:</p>

<p>"Among the Siluroid fishes of Guiana there are several
species which, at certain seasons of the year, have their mouths
and branchial cavities filled either with eggs or young, and, as
is believed, for the purpose of incubation. My attention was
first called to this singular habit by the late Dr. Francis W.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Cragin, formerly United States consul at Paramaribo, Surinam.
In a letter dated August, 1854, he says:</p>

<p>"'The eggs you will receive are from another fish. The different
fishermen have repeatedly assured me that these eggs
in their nearly mature state are carried in the mouths of the
parent till the young are relieved by the bursting of the sac.
Do you either know or believe this to be so, and, if possible,
where are the eggs conceived and how do they get into the
mouth?'</p>

<p>"In the month of April, 1857, on visiting the market of
Paramaribo, I found that this statement, which at first seemed
to be very improbable, was correct as to the existence of eggs
in the mouths of several species of fish. In a tray of fish which
a negro woman offered for sale, I found the mouths of several
filled with either eggs or young, and subsequently an abundance
of opportunities occurred for repeating the observation.
The kinds most commonly known to the colonists, especially
to the negroes, are <i>jara-bakka</i>, <i>njinge-njinge</i>, <i>k&oelig;pra</i>, <i>makrede</i>,
and one or two others, all belonging either to the genus <i>Bagrus</i>
or one nearly allied to it. The first two are quite common in
the market, and I have seen many specimens of them; for the
last two I have the authority of negro fishermen, but have
never seen them myself. The eggs in my collection are of
three different sizes, indicating so many species, one of the
three having been brought to me without the fish from which
they were taken.</p>

<p>"The eggs become quite large before they leave the ovaries,
and are arranged in three zones corresponding to three successive
broods, and probably to be discharged in three successive
years; the mature eggs of a jara-bakka 18 inches long measure
three-fourths of an inch in diameter; those of the second zone,
one-fourth; and those of the third are very minute, about one-sixteenth
of an inch.</p>

<p>"A careful examination of eight specimens of njinge-njinge
about 9 inches long gave the following results:</p>

<p>"The eggs in all instances were carried in the mouths of
the males. This protection, or gestation of the eggs by the
males, corresponds with what has been long noticed with regard
to other fishes, as, for example, <i>Syngnathus</i>, where the mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>supial
pouch for the eggs or young is found in the males only,
and <i>Gasterosteus</i>, where the male constructs the nest and protects
the eggs during incubation from the voracity of the females.</p>

<p>"In some individuals the eggs had been recently laid, in
others they were hatched and the f&oelig;tus had grown at the expense
of some other food than that derived from the yolk, as
this last was not proportionally diminished in size, and the
f&oelig;tus weighed more than the undeveloped egg. The number
of eggs contained in the mouth was between twenty and thirty.
The mouth and branchial cavity were very much distended,
rounding out and distorting the whole hyoid and branchiostegal
region. Some of the eggs even partially protruded from the
mouth. The ova were not bruised or torn as if they had been
bitten or forcibly held by the teeth. In many instances the
f&oelig;tuses were still alive, though the parent had been dead for
many hours.</p>

<p>"No young or eggs were found in the stomach, although
the mouth was crammed to its fullest capacity.</p>

<p>"The above observations apply to njinge-njinge. With regard
to jarra-bakka, I had but few opportunities for dissection,
but in several instances the same conditions of the eggs were
noticed as stated above; and in one instance, besides some
nearly mature f&oelig;tuses contained in the mouth, two or three
were squeezed apparently from the stomach, but not bearing
any marks of violence or of the action of the gastric fluid. It
is probable that these found their way into that last cavity after
death, in consequence of the relaxation of the sphincter which
separates the cavities of the mouth and the stomach. These
facts lead to the conclusion that this is a mouth gestation, as
the eggs are found there in all stages of development, and even
for some time after they are hatched.</p>

<p>"The question will be very naturally asked, how under such
circumstances these fishes are able to secure and swallow their
food. I have made no observations bearing upon such a question.
Unless the food consists of very minute particles it would
seem necessary that during the time of feeding the eggs should
be disgorged. If this supposition be correct, it would give a
very probable explanation of the only fact which might be considered
at variance with the conclusion stated above, viz., that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
we have in these fishes a mouth gestation. In the mass of
eggs with which the mouth is filled I have occasionally found
the eggs, rarely more than one or two, of another species. The
only way in which their presence may be accounted for, it
seems to me, is by the supposition that while feeding the eggs
are disgorged, and as these fishes are gregarious in their habits,
when the ova are recovered the stray eggs of another species
may be introduced into the mouth among those which naturally
belong there."</p>

<p>One of the earliest accounts of this curious habit which
we have seen is that by Dr. G&uuml;nther, referring to specimens
of <i>Tachysurus fissus</i> from Cayenne received from Prof. R.
Owen:</p>

<p>"These specimens having had the cavity of the mouth and
of the gills extended in an extraordinary manner, I was induced
to examine the cause of it, when, to my great surprise, I found
them filled with about twenty eggs, rather larger than an ordinary
pea, perfectly uninjured, and with the embryos in a forward
state of development. The specimens are males, from
6 to 7 inches long, and in each the stomach was almost empty.</p>

<p>"Although the eggs might have been put into the mouth
of the fish by their captor, this does not appear probable. On
the other hand, it is a well-known fact that the American Siluroids
take care of their progeny in various ways; and I have
no doubt that in this species and in its allies the males carry
the eggs in their mouths, depositing them in places of safety
and removing them when they fear the approach of danger or
disturbance."</p>

<p><b>The Unsymmetrical Eyes of Flounders.</b>&mdash;In the two great
families of flounders and soles the head is unsymmetrically
formed, the cranium being twisted and both eyes placed on the
same side. The body is strongly compressed, and the side possessing
the eyes is uppermost in all the actions of the fish.
This upper side, whether right or left, is colored, while the eyeless
side is white or very nearly so.</p>

<p>It is well known that in the very young flounder the body
rests upright in the water. After a little there is a tendency to
turn to one side and the lower eye begins its migration to the
other side, the interorbital bones or part of them moving before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
it. In most flounders the eye seems to move over the surface
of the head, before the dorsal fin, or across the axil of its first
ray. In the tropical genus <i>Platophrys</i> the movement of the eye
is most easily followed, as the species reach a larger size than
do most flounders before the change takes place. The larva,
while symmetrical, is in all cases transparent.</p>

</div>

<p>In a recent study of the migration of the eye in the winter
flounder (<i>Pseudopleuronectes americanus</i>) Mr. Stephen R. Williams
reaches the following conclusions:</p>

<p>1. The young of <i>Limanda ferruginea</i> (the rusty dab) are
probably in the larval stage at the same time as those of <i>Pseudopleuronectes
americanus</i> (the winter flounder).</p>

<p>2. The recently hatched fish are symmetrical, except for the
relative positions of the two optic nerves.</p>

<p>3. The first observed occurrence in preparation for metamorphosis
in <i>P. americanus</i> is the rapid resorption of the part
of the supraorbital cartilage bar which lies in the path of the
eye.</p>

<p>4. Correlated with this is an increase in distance between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the eyes and the brain, caused by the growth of the facial cartilages.</p>

<p>5. The migrating eye moves through an arc of about 120
degrees.</p>

</div>

<p>6. The greater part of this rotation (three-fourths of it in
<i>P. americanus</i>) is a rapid process, taking not more than three
days.</p>

<p>7. The anterior ethmoidal region is not so strongly influenced
by the twisting as the
ocular region.</p>

</div>

<p>8. The location of the olfactory
nerves (in the adult) shows
that the morphological midline
follows the interorbital septum.</p>

<p>9. The cartilage mass lying in the front part of the orbit of
the adult eye is a separate anterior structure in the larva.</p>

<p>10. With unimportant differences, the process of metamorphosis
in the sinistral fish is parallel to that in the dextral
fish.</p>

<p>11. The original location of the eye is indicated in the adult
by the direction first taken, as they leave the brain, by those
cranial nerves having to do with the transposed eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>12. The only well-marked asymmetry in the adult brain is
due to the much larger size of the olfactory nerve and lobe of
the ocular side.</p>

<p>13. There is a perfect chiasma.</p>

<p>14. The optic nerve of the migrating eye is always anterior
to that of the other eye.</p>

</div>

<p>"The why of the peculiar metamorphosis of the <i>Pleuronectid&aelig;</i>
is an unsolved problem. The presence or absence of
a swim-bladder can have nothing to do with the change of
habit of the young flatfish, for <i>P. americanus</i> must lose its air-bladder
before metamorphosis begins, since sections showed no
evidence of it, whereas in <i>Lophopsetta maculata</i>, 'the windowpane
flounder,' the air-sac can often be seen by the naked eye
up to the time when the fish assumes the adult coloration, and
long after it has assumed the adult form.</p>

<p>"Cunningham has suggested that the weight of the fish
acting upon the lower eye after the turning would press it
toward the upper side out of the way. But in all probability the
planktonic larva rests on the sea-bottom little if at all before
metamorphosing. Those taken by Mr. Williams into the laboratory
showed in resting no preference for either side until the eye
was near the midline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"The fact that the change in all fishes is repeated during the
development of each individual fish has been used to support
the proposition that the flatfishes as a family
are a comparatively recent product. They
are, on the other hand, comparatively
ancient. According to Zittel flatfishes of
species referable to genera living at present,
<i>Rhombus</i> (<i>Bothus</i>) and <i>Solea</i>, are found in
the Eocene deposits. These two genera
are notable in that <i>Bothus</i> is one of the
least and <i>Solea</i> the most unsymmetrical of
the <i>Pleuronectid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 481px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 132.</span>&mdash;Face view of
recently hatched Flounder.
(After S. R. Williams.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The degree of asymmetry can be correlated
with the habit of the animal. Those
fishes, such as the sole and shore-dwelling
flounders, which keep to the bottom are the
most twisted representatives of the family,
while the more freely swimming forms, like the sand-dab,
summer flounder, and halibut, are more nearly symmetrical.
Asymmetry must be of more advantage to those fishes which
grub in the mud for their food than to those which capture
other fishes; of the latter those which move with the greatest
freedom are the most symmetrical.</p>

<p>"This deviation from the bilateral condition must have come
about either as a 'sport' or by gradual modification of the
adults. If by the latter method&mdash;the change proving to be advantageous&mdash;selection
favored its appearing earlier and earlier
in ontogeny, until it occurred in the stages of planktonic life.
Metamorphosis at a stage earlier than this would be a distinct
disadvantage, because of the lack of the customary planktonic
food at the sea-bottom. At present some forms of selection
are probably continually at work fixing the limit of the period
of metamorphosis by the removal of those individuals which
attempt the transformation at unsuitable epochs; for instance,
at the time of hatching. That there are such individuals is
shown by Fullarton, who figures a fish just hatched 'anticipating
the twisting and subsequent unequal development exhibited
by the head of Pleuronectids.' Those larv&aelig; which
remain pelagic until better able to compete at the sea-bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
become the adults which fix the time of metamorphosis on their
progeny." (<span class="smcap">S. R. Williams.</span>)</p>

<p>So far as known to the writer, the metamorphosis of flounders
always occurs while the individual is still translucent and
swimming at the surface of the sea before sinking to the bottom.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Spines</span> of the Catfishes.</b>&mdash;The catfishes or horned pouts
(<i>Silurid&aelig;</i>) have a strong spine in the pectoral fin, one
or both edges of this being jagged or serrated. This
spine fits into a peculiar joint and by means of a slight downward
or forward twist can be set immovably. It can then be broken
more easily than it can be depressed. A slight turn in the opposite
direction releases the joint, a fact known to the fish and readily
learned by the boy. The sharp spine inflicts a jagged wound.
Pelicans which have swallowed the catfish have been known to
die of the wounds inflicted by the fish's spine. When the catfish
was first introduced into the Sacramento, according to Mr. Will
S. Green, it caused the death of many of the native "Sacramento
perch" (<i>Archoplites interruptus</i>). This perch (or rather
bass) fed on the young catfish, and the latter erecting their
pectoral spines in turn caused the death of the perch by tearing
the walls of its stomach. In like manner the sharp dorsal
and ventral spines of the sticklebacks have been known to cause
the death of fishes who swallow them, and even of ducks. In
Puget Sound the stickleback is often known as salmon-killer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>Certain small catfishes known as stone-cats and mad-toms
(<i>Noturus</i>, <i>Schilbeodes</i>), found in the rivers of the Southern and
Middle Western States, are provided with special organs of
offense. At the base of the pectoral spine, which is sometimes
very jagged, is a structure supposed by Professor Cope to be a
poison gland the nature of which has not yet been fully ascertained.
The wounds made by these spines are exceedingly
painful like those made by the sting of a wasp. They are,
however, apparently not dangerous.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Venomous Spines.</b>&mdash;Many species of scorpion-fishes (<i>Scorp&aelig;na</i>,
<i>Synanceia</i>, <i>Pelor</i>, <i>Pterois</i>, etc.), found in warm seas,
as well as the European weavers (<i>Trachinus</i>), secrete poison
from under the skin of each dorsal spine. The wounds made
by these spines are very exasperating, but are not often dangerous.
In some cases the glands producing these poisons form an
oblong bag excreting a milky juice, and placed on the base of
the spine.</p>

<p>In <i>Thalassophryne</i>, a genus of toad-fishes of tropical America,
is found the most perfect system of poison organs known among
fishes. The spinous armature of the opercle and the two spines
of the first dorsal fin constitute the weapons. The details are
known from the dissections of Dr. G&uuml;nther. According to his<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
observations, the opercle in <i>Thalassophryne</i> "is very narrow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>vertically styliform and very mobile. It is armed behind with
a spine eight lines long and of the same form as the hollow
venom-fang of a snake, being perforated at its base and at its
extremity. A sac covering the base of the spine discharges its
contents through the apertures and the canal in the interior of
the spine. The structure of the dorsal spines is similar. There
are no secretory glands imbedded in the membranes of the sacs
and the fluid must be secreted by their mucous membrane. The
sacs are without an external muscular layer and situated immediately
below the thick, loose skin which envelops the spines
at their extremity. The ejection of the poison into a living
animal, therefore, can only be effected as in <i>Synanceia</i>, by the
pressure to which the sac is subjected the moment the spine
enters another body."</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Lancet of the Surgeon-fish.</b>&mdash;Some fishes defend themselves
by lashing their enemies with their tails. In the tangs, or surgeon-fishes
(<i>Teuthis</i>), the tail is provided with a formidable weapon,
a knife-like spine, with the sharp edge directed forward. This
spine when not in use slips forward into a sheath. The fish,
when alive, cannot be handled without danger of a severe cut.</p>

<p>In the related genera, this lancet is very much more blunt
and immovable, degenerating at last into the rough spines of
<i>Balistapus</i> or the hair-like prickles of <i>Monacanthus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Spines of the Sting-ray.</b>&mdash;In all the large group of sting-rays
the tail is provided with one or more large, stiff, barbed
spines, which are used with great force by the animal, and are
capable of piercing the leathery skin of the sting-ray itself.
There is no evidence that these spines bear any specific poison,
but the ragged wounds they make are always dangerous and
often end in gangrene. It is possible that the mucus on the
surface of the spine acts as a poison on the lacerated tissues,
rendering the wound something very different from a simple cut.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Protection Through Poisonous Flesh of Fishes.</b>&mdash;In certain
groups of fishes a strange form of self-protection is acquired by
the presence in the body of poisonous alkaloids, by means of
which the enemies of the species are destroyed in the death
of the individual devoured.</p>

<p>Such alkaloids are present in the globefishes (<i>Tetraodontid&aelig;</i>),
the filefishes (<i>Monacanthus</i>), and in some related forms, while
members of other groups (<i>Batrachoidid&aelig;</i>) are under suspicion in
this regard. The alkaloids produce a disease known as ciguatera,
characterized by paralysis and gastric derangements.
Severe cases of ciguatera with men, as well as with lower
animals, may end fatally in a short time.</p>

<p>The flesh of the filefishes (<i>Stephanolepis tomentosus</i>), which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the writer has tested, is very meager and bitter, having a decidedly
offensive taste. It is suspected, probably justly, of being
poisonous. In the globefishes the flesh is always more or
less poisonous, that of <i>Tetraodon hispidus</i>, called muki-muki,
or death-fish, in Hawaii, is reputed as excessively so. The poisonous
fishes have been lately studied in detail by Dr. Jacques
Pellegrin, of the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle at Paris. He
shows that any species of fish may be poisonous under certain
circumstances, that under certain conditions certain species are
poisonous, and that certain kinds are poisonous more or less at
all times. The following account is condensed from Dr. Pellegrin's
observations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_183.jpg" width="600" height="319" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 137.</span>&mdash;<i>Tetraodon meleagris</i> (Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de). Riu Kiu Islands.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The flesh of fishes soon undergoes decomposition in hot
climates. The consumption of decayed fish may produce
serious disorders, usually with symptoms of diarrh&oelig;a or eruption
of the skin. There is in this case no specific poison, but
the formation of leucomaines through the influence of bacteria.
This may take place with other kinds of flesh, and is known as
botulism, or allantiasis. For this disease, as produced by the
flesh of fishes, Dr. Pellegrin suggests the name of ichthyosism
It is especially severe in certain very oily fishes, as the tunny,
the anchovy, or the salmon. The flesh of these and other fishes
occasionally produces similar disorders through mere indigestion.
In this case the flesh undergoes decay in the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>In certain groups (wrasse-fishes, parrot-fishes, etc.) in the
tropics, individual fishes are sometimes rendered poisonous by
feeding on poisonous mussels, holothurians, or possibly polyps,
species which at certain times, and especially in their spawning
season, develops alkaloids which themselves may cause ciguatera.
In this case it is usually the very old or large fishes which
are liable to be infected. In some markets numerous species
are excluded as suspicious for this reason. Such a list is in
use in the fish-market of Havana, where the sale of certain
species, elsewhere healthful, or at the most suspected, was rigidly
prohibited under the Spanish r&eacute;gime. A list of these suspicious
fishes has been given by Prof. Poey.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_184.jpg" width="700" height="411" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 138.</span>&mdash;The Trigger-fish, <i>Balistes carolinensis</i> Gmelin. New York.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In many of the eels the serum of the blood is poisonous, but
its venom is destroyed by the gastric juice, so that the flesh
may be eaten with impunity, unless decay has set in. To eat
too much of the tropical morays is to invite gastric troubles,
but no true ciguatera. The true ciguatera is produced by a
specific poisonous alkaloid. This is most developed in the
globefishes or puffers (<i>Tetraodon</i>, <i>Spheroides</i>, <i>Tropidichthys</i>, etc.).
It is present in the filefishes (<i>Monacanthus</i>, <i>Alutera</i>, etc.), probably
in some toad-fishes (<i>Batrachoides</i>, etc.), and similar compounds
are found in the flesh of sharks and especially in sharks'
livers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>These alkaloids are most developed in the ovaries and testes,
and in the spawning season. They are also found in the liver
and sometimes elsewhere in the body. In many species otherwise
innocuous, purgative alkaloids are developed in or about
the eggs. Serious illness has been caused by eating the roe of
the pike and the barbel. The poison is less virulent in the
species which ascend the rivers. It is also much less developed
in cooler waters. For this reason ciguatera is almost confined
to the tropics. In Havana, Manila, and other tropical ports it
is of frequent occurrence, while northward it is practically unknown
as a disease requiring a special name or treatment. On
the coast of Alaska, about Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet,
a fatal disease resembling ciguatera has been occasionally produced
by the eating of clams.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 139.</span>&mdash;Numbfish, <i>Narcine brasiliensis</i> Henle, showing <i>electric cells</i>.
Pensacola, Florida.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The purpose of the alkaloids producing ciguatera is considered
by Dr. Pellegrin as protective, saving the species by the
poisoning of its enemies. The sickness caused by the specific
poison must be separated from that produced by ptomaines and
leucomaines in decaying flesh or in the oil diffused through it.
Poisonous bacteria may be destroyed by cooking, but the alkaloids
which cause ciguatera are unaltered by heat.</p>

<p>It is claimed in tropical regions that the germs of the bubonic
plague may be carried through the mediation of fishes
which feed on sewage. It is suggested by Dr. Charles B. Ash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>mead
that leprosy may be so carried. It is further suggested
that the custom of eating the flesh of fishes raw almost universal
in Japan, Hawaii, and other regions may be responsible
for the spread of certain contagious diseases, in which the fish
acts as an intermediate host, much as certain mosquitoes spread
the germ of malaria and yellow fever.</p>

<p><b>Electric Fishes.</b>&mdash;Several species of fishes possess the power
to inflict electric shocks not unlike those of the Leyden jar.
This is useful in stunning their prey and especially in confounding
their enemies. In most cases these electric organs are
evidently developed from muscular substance. Their action,
which is largely voluntary, is in its nature like muscular action.
The power is soon exhausted and must be restored by rest and
food. The effects of artificial stimulation and of poisons are
parallel with the effect of similar agents on muscles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 140.</span>&mdash;Electric Catfish, <i>Torpedo electricus</i> (Gmelin). Congo River.
(Alter Boulenger.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the electric rays or torpedos (<i>Narcobatid&aelig;</i>) the electric
organs are large honeycomb-like structures, "vertical hexagonal
prisms," upwards of 400 of them, at the base of the pectoral
fins. Each prism is filled "with a clear trembling jelly-like
substance." These fishes give a shock which is communicable
through a metallic conductor, as an iron spear or the handle of
a knife. It produces a peculiar and disagreeable sensation not
at all dangerous. It is said that this living battery shows all
the known qualities of magnetism, rendering the needle magnetic,
decomposing chemical compounds, etc. In the Nile is
an electric catfish (<i>Torpedo electricus</i>) having similar powers.
Its electric organ extends over the whole body, being thickest
below. It consists of rhomboidal cells of a firm gelatinous
substance.</p>

<p>The electric eel (<i>Electrophorus electricus</i>), the most powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of electric fishes, is not an eel, but allied rather to the sucker or
carp. It is, however, eel-like in form and lives in rivers of Brazil
and Guiana. The electric organs are in two pairs, one on the back
of the tail, the other on the
anal fin. These are made up
of an enormous number of
minute cells. In the electric
eel, as in the other electric
fishes, the nerves supplying
these organs are much larger
than those passing from the
spinal cord for any other purpose.
In all these cases
closely related species show a
no trace of the electric powers.</p>

<p>Dr. Gilbert has described
the electric powers of species
of star-gazer (<i>Astroscopus
y-gr&aelig;cum</i> and <i>A. zephyreus</i>),
the electric cells lying under
the naked skin of the top of
the head. Electric power is
ascribed to a species of cusk
(<i>Urophycis regius</i>), but this
perhaps needs verification.</p>

<p><b>Photophores or Luminous
Organs.</b>&mdash;Many fishes, chiefly
of the deep seas, develop
organs for producing light.
These are known as luminous
organs, phosphorescent organs,
or photophores. These
are independently developed
in four entirely unrelated
groups of fishes. This difference
in origin is accompanied
by corresponding difference in structure. The best-known
type is found in the Iniomi, including the lantern-fishes and
their many relatives. These may have luminous spots, differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>entiated
areas round or oblong which shine star-like in the
dark. These are usually symmetrically placed on the sides of
the body. They may have also luminous glands or diffuse areas
which are luminous, but which do not show the specialized
structure of the phosphorescent spots. These glands of similar
nature to the spots are mostly on the head or tail. In one
genus, <i>&AElig;thoprora</i>, the luminous snout is compared to the headlight
of an engine.</p>

<p>Entirely different are the photophores in the midshipman
or singing-fish (<i>Porichthys</i>), a genus of toad-fishes or <i>Batrachoidid&aelig;</i>.
This species lives near the shore and the luminous
spots are outgrowths from pores of the lateral line.</p>

<p>In one of the anglers (<i>Corynolophus reinhardti</i>) the complex
bait is said to be luminous, and luminous areas are said to
occur on the belly of a very small shark of the deep seas of
Japan (<i>Etmopterus lucifer</i>). This phenomenon is now the subject
of study by one of the numerous pupils of Dr. Mitsukuri.
The structures in <i>Corynolophus</i> are practically unknown.</p>

<p><b>Photophores in Iniomous Fishes.</b>&mdash;In the <i>Iniomi</i> the luminous
organs have been the subject of an elaborate paper by Dr.
R. von Lendenfeld (Deep-sea Fishes of the Challenger. Appendix
B). These he divides into ocellar organs of regular
form or luminous spots, and irregular glandular organs or
luminous areas. The ocellar spots may be on the scales
of the lateral line or on other definite areas. They may be
raised above the surface or sunk below it. They may be simple,
with or without black pigment, or they may have within them
a reflecting surface. They are best shown in the <i>Myctophid&aelig;</i>
and <i>Stomiatid&aelig;</i>, but are found in numerous other families in
nearly all soft-rayed fishes of the deep sea.</p>

<p>The glandular areas may be placed on the lower jaw, on the
barbels, under the gill cover, on the suborbital or preorbital,
on the tail, or they may be irregularly scattered. Those about
the eye have usually the reflecting membrane.</p>

<p>In all these structures, according to Dr. von Lendenfeld, the
whole or part of the organ is glandular. The glandular part
is at the base and the other structures are added distally. The
primitive organ was a gland which produced luminous slime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
To this in the process of specialization greater complexity has
been added.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>

<p>The luminous organs of some fishes resemble the supposed
original structure of the primitive photophore, though of
course these cannot actually represent it. The simplest type
of photophore now found is in <i>Astronesthes</i>, in the form of
irregular glandular luminous patches on the surface of the skin.
There is no homology between the luminous organs of any insect
and those of any fish.</p>

<p><b>Photophores of Porichthys.</b>&mdash;Entirely distinct in their origin
are the luminous spots in the midshipman (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>),
a shore fish of California. These have been described in detail
by Dr. Charles Wilson Greene (late of Stanford University, now
of the University of Missouri) in the <i>Journal of Morphology</i>,
xv., p. 667. These are found on various parts of the body in
connection with the mucous pores of the lateral lines and about
the mucous pores of the head. The skin in <i>Porichthys</i> is naked,
and the photophores arise from a modification of its epidermis.
Each is spherical, shining white, and consists of four parts&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
lens, the gland, the reflector, and the pigment. As to its function
Prof. Greene observes:</p>

<p>"I have kept specimens of <i>Porichthys</i> in aquaria at the Hopkins
Seaside Laboratory, and have made numerous observations
on them with an effort to secure ocular proof of the phosphorescence
of the living active fish. The fish was observed in
the dark when quiet and when violently excited, but, with a
single exception, only negative results were obtained. Once
a phosphorescent glow of scarcely perceptible intensity was
observed when the fish was pressed against the side of the
aquarium. Then, this is a shore fish and quite common, and
one might suppose that so striking a phenomenon as it would
present if these organs were phosphorescent in a small degree
would be observed by ichthyologists in the field, or by fishermen,
but diligent inquiry reveals no such evidence.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the fact that <i>Porichthys</i> has been observed
to voluntarily exhibit only the trace of phosphorescence mentioned
above, still the organs which it possesses in such numbers
are beyond doubt true phosphorescent organs, as the following
observations will demonstrate. A live fish put into an
aquarium of sea-water made alkaline with ammonia water exhibited
a most brilliant glow along the location of the well-developed
organs. Not only did the lines of organs shine
forth, but the individual organs themselves were distinguishable.
The glow appeared after about five minutes, remained
prominent for a few minutes, and then for twenty minutes
gradually became weaker until it was scarcely perceptible.
Rubbing the hand over the organs was followed always by a
distinct increase in the phosphorescence. Pieces of the fish
containing the organs taken five and six hours after the death
of the animal became luminous upon treatment with ammonia
water.</p>

<p>"Electrical stimulation of the live fish was also tried with
good success. The interrupted current from an induction coil
was used, one electrode being fixed on the head over the brain
or on the exposed spinal cord near the brain, and the other
moved around on different parts of the body. No results followed
relatively weak stimulation of the fish, although such
currents produced violent contractions of the muscular system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of the body. But when a current strong enough to be quite
painful to the hands while handling the electrodes was used
then stimulation of the fish called forth a brilliant glow of light
apparently from every well-developed photophore. All the
lines on the ventral and lateral surfaces of the body glowed
with a beautiful light, and continued to do so while the stimulation
lasted. The single well-developed organ just back of
and below the eye was especially prominent. No luminosity
was observed in the region of the dorsal organs previously described
as rudimentary in structure. I was also able to produce
the same effect by galvanic stimulation, rapidly making and
breaking the current by hand.</p>

Girard. Family <i>Batrachoidid&aelig;</i>. Monterey, California. (After Greene.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The light produced in <i>Porichthys</i> was, as near as could be
determined by direct observation, a white light. When produced
by electric stimulation it did not suddenly reach its
maximal intensity, but came in quite gradually and disappeared
in the same way when the stimulation ceased. The light was
not a strong one, only strong enough to enable one to quite
easily distinguish the apparatus used in the experiment.</p>

<p>"An important fact brought out by the above experiment is
that an electrical stimulation strong enough to most violently
stimulate the nervous system, as shown by the violent contractions
of the muscular system, may still be too weak to
produce phosphorescence. This fact gives a physiological con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>firmation
of the morphological result stated above that no
specific nerves are distributed to the phosphorescent organs.</p>

<p>"I can explain the action of the electrical current in these
experiments only on the supposition that it produces its effect
by direct action on the gland.</p>

</div>

<p>"The experiments just related were all tried on specimens of
the fish taken from under the rocks where they were guarding
the young brood. Two specimens, however, taken by hooks
from the deeper water of Monterey Bay, could not be made to
show phosphorescence either by electrical stimulation or by
treatment with ammonia. These specimens did net have the
high development of the system of mucous cells of the skin
exhibited by the nesting fish. My observations were, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>ever,
not numerous enough to more than suggest the possibility
of a seasonal high development of the phosphorescent organs.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 148.</span>&mdash;Section of the deeper portion of phosphorescent organ of <i>Porichthys
notatus</i>, highly magnified. (After Greene.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Two of the most important parts of the organ have to do
with the physical manipulation of light&mdash;the reflector and the
lens, respectively. The property of the reflector needs no discussion
other than to call attention to its enormous development.
The lens cells are composed of a highly refractive substance,
and the part as a whole gives every evidence of light
refraction and condensation. The form of the lens gives a
theoretical condensation of light at a very short focus. That
such is in reality the case, I have proved conclusively by examination
of fresh material. If the fresh fish be exposed to direct
sunlight, there is a reflected spot of intense light from each
phosphorescent organ. This spot is constant in position with
reference to the sun in whatever position the fish be turned
and is lost if the lens be dissected away and only the reflector
left. With needles and a simple microscope it is comparatively
easy to free the lens from the surrounding tissue and to examine
it directly. When thus freed and examined in normal saline, I
have found by rough estimates that it condenses sunlight to a
bright point a distance back of the lens of from one-fourth to
one-half its diameter. I regret that I have been unable to make
precise physical developments.</p>

<p>"The literature on the histological structure of known phosphorescent
organs of fishes is rather meager and unsatisfactory.
Von Lendenfeld describes twelve classes of phosphorescent
organs from deep-sea fishes collected by the <i>Challenger</i> expe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>dition.
All of these, however, are greater or less modifications
of one type. This type includes, according to von Lendenfeld's
views, three essential parts, <i>i.e.</i>, a gland, phosphorescent cells,
and a local ganglion. These parts may have added a reflector,
a pigment layer, or both; and all these may be simple or compounded
in various ways, giving rise to the twelve classes.
Blood-vessels and nerves are distributed to the glandular portion.
Of the twelve classes direct ocular proof is given for
one, i.e., ocellar organs of <i>Myctophum</i> which were observed by
Willemoes-Suhm at night to shine 'like a star in the net.' Von
Lendenfeld says that the gland produces a secretion, and he
supposes the light or phosphorescence to be produced either
by the 'burning or consuming' of this secretion by the phosphorescent
cells, or else by some substance produced by the
phosphorescent cells. Furthermore, he says that the phosphorescent
cells act at the 'will of the fish' and are excited
to action by the local ganglion.</p>

<p>"Some of these statements and conclusions seem insufficiently
grounded, as, for example, the supposed action of the phosphorescent
cells, and especially the control of the ganglion
over them. In the first place, the relation between the ganglion
and the central nervous system in the forms described by von
Lendenfeld is very obscure, and the structure described as a
ganglion, to judge from the figures and the text descriptions,
may be wrongly identified. At least it is scarcely safe to
ascribe ganglionic function to a group of adult cells so poorly
preserved that only nuclei are to be distinguished. In the
second place, no structural character is shown to belong to the
'phosphorescent cells' by which they may take part in the
process ascribed to them.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>"The action of the organs described by him may be explained
on other grounds, and entirely independent of the so-called
'ganglion cells' and of the 'phosphorescent cells.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>
<p>"Phosphorescence as applied to the production of light by a
living animal is, according to our present ideas, a chemical action,
<i>an oxidation process</i>. The necessary conditions for producing it
are two&mdash;an oxidizable substance that is luminous on oxidation,
i.e., a photogenic substance on the one hand, and the presence
of free oxygen on the other. Every phosphorescent organ
must have a mechanism for producing these two conditions;
all other factors are only secondary and accessory. If the
gland of a firefly can produce a substance that is oxidizable
and luminous on oxidation, as shown as far back as 1828 by
Faraday and confirmed and extended recently by Watas&eacute;, it is
conceivable, indeed probable, that phosphorescence in <i>Myctophum</i>
and other deep-sea forms is produced in the same direct way,
that is, by direct oxidation of the secretion of the gland found
in each of at least ten of the twelve groups of organs described
by von Lendenfeld. Free oxygen may be supplied directly
from the blood in the capillaries distributed to the gland
which he describes. The possibility of the regulation of the
supply of blood carrying oxygen is analogous to what takes
place in the firefly and is wholly adequate to account for any
'flashes of light' 'at the will of the fish.'</p>

<p>"In the phosphorescent organs of <i>Porichthys</i> the only part
the function of which cannot be explained on physical grounds
is the group of cells called the gland. If the large granular
cells of this portion of the structure produce a secretion, as seems
probable from the character of the cells and their behavior
toward reagents, and this substance be oxidizable and luminous
in the presence of free oxygen, i.e., photogenic, then we have
the conditions necessary for a light-producing organ. The
numerous capillaries distributed to the gland will supply free
oxygen sufficient to meet the needs of the case. Light produced
in the gland is ultimately all projected to the exterior,
either directly from the luminous points in the gland or reflected
outward by the reflector, the lens condensing all the rays into
a definite pencil or slightly diverging cone. This explanation
of the light-producing process rests on the assumption of a
secretion product with certain specific characters. But comparing
the organ with structures known to produce such a substance,
i.e., the glands of the firefly or the photospheres of Eu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>phausia,
it seems to me the assumption is not less certain than
the assumption that twelve structures resembling each other in
certain particulars have a common function to that proved for
one only of the twelve.</p>

<p>"I am inclined to the belief that whatever regulation of the
action of the phosphorescent organ occurs is controlled by the
regulation of the supply of free oxygen by the blood-stream
flowing through the organ; but, however this may be, the essential
fact remains that the organs in <i>Porichthys</i> are true phosphorescent
organs." (<span class="smcap">Greene.</span>)</p>

<p>Other species of <i>Porichthys</i> with similar photophores occur
in Texas, Guiana, Panama, and Chile. The name midshipman
alludes to these shining spots, compared to buttons.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Globefishes.</b>&mdash;The globefishes (<i>Tetraodon</i>, etc.) and the porcupine-fishes
have the surface defended by spines. These fishes
have an additional safeguard through the instinct to swallow
air. When one of these fishes is seriously disturbed it rises to
the surface, gulps air into a capacious sac, and then floats belly
upward on the surface. It is thus protected from other fishes,
although easily taken by man. The same habit appears in some
of the frog-fishes (<i>Antennarius</i>) and in the Swell sharks (<i>Cephaloscyllium</i>).</p>

<p>The writer once hauled out a netful of globefishes (<i>Tetraodon
hispidus</i>) from a Hawaiian lagoon. As they lay on the bank
a dog came up and sniffed at them. As his nose touched them
they swelled themselves up with air, becoming visibly two or
three times as large as before. It is not often that the lower
animals show surprise at natural phenomena, but the attitude
of the dog left no question as to his feeling.</p>

<p><b>Remoras.</b>&mdash;The different species of Remora, or shark-suckers,
fasten themselves to the surface of sharks or other fishes and
are carried about by them often to great distances. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
fishes attach themselves by a large sucking-disk on the top of
the head, which is a modified spinous dorsal fin. They do not
harm the shark, except possibly to retard its motion. If the
shark is caught and drawn out of the water, these fishes often
instantly let go and plunge into the sea, swimming away with
great celerity.</p>

<p><b>Sucking-disks of Clingfishes.</b>&mdash;Other fishes have sucking-disks
differently made, by which they cling to rocks. In the
gobies the united ventrals have some adhesive power. The
blind goby (<i>Typhlogobius californiensis</i>) is said to adhere to rocks
in dark holes by the ventral fins. In most gobies the adhesive
power is slight. In the sea-snails (<i>Liparidid&aelig;</i>) and lumpfishes
(<i>Cyclopterid&aelig;</i>) the united ventral fins are modified into an
elaborate circular sucking-disk. In the clingfishes (<i>Gobiesocid&aelig;</i>)
the sucking-disk lies between the ventral fins and is made in
part of modified folds of the naked skin. Some fishes creep
over the bottom, exploring it with their sensitive barbels, as
the gurnard, surmullet, and goatfish. The suckers (<i>Catostomus</i>)
test the bottom with their thick, sensitive lips, either puckered
or papillose, feeding by suction.</p>

<p><b>Lampreys and Hagfishes.</b>&mdash;The lampreys suck the blood of
other fishes to which they fasten themselves by their disk-like
mouth armed with rasping teeth.</p>

<p>The hagfishes (<i>Myxine</i>, <i>Eptatretus</i>) alone among fishes are
truly parasitic. These fishes, worm-like in form, have round
mouths, armed with strong hooked teeth. They fasten themselves
at the throats of large fishes, work their way into the
muscle without tearing the skin, and finally once inside devour
all the muscles of the fish, leaving the skin unbroken and the
viscera undisturbed. These fishes become living hulks before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
they die. If lifted out of the water, the slimy hagfish at once
slips out and swims quickly away. In gill-nets in Monterey
Bay great mischief is done by hagfish (<i>Polistotrema stouti</i>). It
is a curious fact that large numbers of hagfish eggs are taken
from the stomachs of the male hagfish, which seems to be
almost the only enemy of his own species, keeping the numbers
in check.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Swordfishes.</b>&mdash;In the swordfish and its relatives, the sailfish
and the spearfish, the bones of the anterior part of the
head are grown together, making an efficient organ of attack.
The sword of the swordfish, the most powerful of these fishes,
has been known to pierce the long planks of boats, and it is
supposed that the animal sometimes attacks the whale. But
stories of this sort lack verification.</p>

<p><b>The Paddle-fishes.</b>&mdash;In the paddle-fishes (<i>Polyodon spatula</i> and
<i>Psephurus gladius</i>) the snout is spread out forming a broad
paddle or spatula. This the animal uses to stir up the mud
on the bottoms of rivers, the small organisms contained in
mud constituting food. Similar paddle-like projections are
developed in certain deep-water Chim&aelig;ras (<i>Harriottia</i>, <i>Rhinochim&aelig;ra</i>),
and in the deep-sea shark, <i>Mitsukurina</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Sawfishes.</b>&mdash;A certain genus of rays (<i>Pristis</i>, the sawfish)
and a genus of sharks (<i>Pristiophorus</i>, the saw-shark), possess
a similar spatula-shaped snout. But in these fishes the
snout is provided on either side with enamelled teeth set in
sockets and standing at right angles with the snout. The
animal swims through schools of sardines and anchovies, strikes
right and left with this saw, destroying the small fishes, who
thus become an easy prey. These fishes live in estuaries and
river mouths, <i>Pristis</i> in tropical America and Guinea, <i>Pristiophorus</i>
in Japan and Australia. In the mythology of science, the
sawfish attacks the whale, but in fact the two animals never
come within miles of each other, and the sawfish is an object of
danger only to the tender fishes, the small fry of the sea.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Peculiarities of Jaws and Teeth.</b>&mdash;The jaws of fishes are subject
to a great variety of modifications. In some the bones are
joined by distensible ligaments and the fish can swallow other
fishes larger than itself. In other cases the jaws are excessively
small and toothless, at the end of a long tube, so ineffective in
appearance that it is a marvel that the fish can swallow anything
at all.</p>

<p>In the thread-eels (<i>Nemichthys</i>) the jaws are so recurved
that they cannot possibly meet, and in their great length seem
worse than useless.</p>

<p>In some species the knife-like canines of the lower jaw pierce
through the substance of the upper.</p>

<p>In four different and wholly unrelated groups of fishes the
teeth are grown fast together, forming a horny beak like that of
the parrot. These are the Chim&aelig;ras, the globefishes (<i>Tetraodon</i>),
and their relatives, the parrot-fishes (<i>Scarus</i>, etc.), and the
stone-wall perch (<i>Oplegnathus</i>). The structure of the beak
varies considerably in these four cases, in accord with the difference
in the origin of its structures. In the globefishes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
jaw-bones are fused together, and in the Chim&aelig;ras they are
solidly joined to the cranium itself.</p>

<p><b>The Angler-fishes.</b>&mdash;In the large group of angler-fishes the first
spine of the dorsal fin is modified into a sort of bait to attract
smaller fishes into the capacious mouth below. This structure
is typical in the fishing-frog (<i>Lophius</i>), where the fleshy tip of
this spine hangs over the great mouth, the huge fish lying on
the bottom apparently inanimate as a stone. In other related
fishes this spine has different forms, being often reduced to a
vestige, of little value as a lure, but retained in accordance
with the law of heredity. In a deep-sea angler the bait is
enlarged, provided with fleshy streamers and a luminous body
which serves to attract small fishes in the depths.</p>

<p>The forms and uses of this spine in this group constitute a
very suggestive chapter in the study of specialization and ultimate
degradation, when the special function is not needed or
becomes ineffective.</p>

<p>Similar phases of excessive development and final degradation
may be found in almost every group in which abnormal
stress has been laid on a particular organ. Thus the ventral
fins, made into a large sucking-disk in <i>Liparis</i>, are lost altogether
in <i>Paraliparis</i>. The very large poisoned spines of <i>Pterois</i>
become very short in <i>Aploactis</i>, the high dorsal spines of <i>Citula</i>
are lost in <i>Alectis</i>, and sometimes a very large organ dwindles
to a very small one within the limits of the same genus. An
example of this is seen in the poisoned pectoral spines of
<i>Schilbeodes</i>.</p>

<p><b>Relation of Number of Vertebr&aelig; to Temperature and the Struggle
for Existence.</b>&mdash;One of the most remarkable modifications
of the skeleton of fishes is the progressive increase of the
number of vertebr&aelig; as the forms become less specialized, and
that this particular form of specialization is greatest at the
equator.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>It has been known for some years that in several groups of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>fishes (wrasse-fishes, flounders, and "rock-cod," for example)
those species which inhabit northern waters have more vertebr&aelig;
than those living in the tropics. Certain arctic flounders, for
example, have sixty vertebr&aelig;; tropical flounders have, on the
average, thirty. The significance of this fact is the problem at
issue. In science it is assumed that all facts have significance,
else they would not exist. It becomes necessary, then, to find
out first just what the facts are in this regard.</p>

</div>

<p>Going through the various groups of non-migratory marine
fishes we find that such relations are common. In almost every
group the number of vertebr&aelig; grows smaller as we approach the
equator, and grows larger again as we pass into southern latitudes.
Taking an average netful of fishes of different kinds
at different places along the coast, the variation would be evident.
At Point Barrow or Cape Farewell or North Cape a
seineful of fishes would perhaps average eighty vertebr&aelig; each,
the body lengthened to make room for them; at Sitka or St.
Johns or Bergen, perhaps sixty vertebr&aelig;; at San Francisco or
New York or St. Malo, thirty-five; at Mazatlan or Pensacola or
Naples, twenty-eight; and at Panama or Havana or Sierra
Leone, twenty-five. Under the equator the usual number of
vertebr&aelig; in shore fishes is twenty-four. Outside tropical and
semi-tropical waters this number is the exception. North of
Cape Cod it is virtually unknown.</p>

<p><b>Number of Vertebr&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The numbers of vertebr&aelig; in different
groups may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p><i>Lancelets.</i>&mdash;Among the lancelets the numbers of segments
range from 50 to 80, there being no vertebr&aelig;.</p>

<p><i>Lampreys.</i>&mdash;In this group the number of segments ranges
from 100 to 150.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Elasmobranchs.</i>&mdash;Among sharks and skates the usual number
of segments is from 100 to 150 and upwards. In the extinct
species as far as known the numbers are not materially different.
The Carboniferous genus, <i>Pleuracanthus</i>, has about 115 vertebr&aelig;.
The <i>Chim&aelig;ras</i> have similar numbers; <i>Chim&aelig;ra monstrosa</i> has
about 100 in the body and more than as many more in the filamentous
tail.</p>

<p><i>Cycli&aelig;.</i>&mdash;<i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> has about 85 vertebr&aelig;.</p>

<p><i>Arthrodires.</i>&mdash;There are about 100 vertebr&aelig; in <i>Coccosteus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dipnoans.</i>&mdash;In Protopterus there are upwards of 100 vertebr&aelig;,
the last much reduced in size. Figures of <i>Neoceratodus</i> show
about 80.</p>

<p><i>Crossopterygians.</i>&mdash;<i>Polypterus</i> has 67 vertebr&aelig;; <i>Erpetichthys</i>,
110; <i>Undina</i>, about 85.</p>

<p><i>Ganoids.</i>&mdash;In this group the numbers are also large&mdash;95 in
<i>Amia</i>, about 55 in the short-bodied <i>Microdon</i>. The Sturgeons
all have more than 100 vertebr&aelig;.</p>

<p><b>Soft-rayed Fishes.</b>&mdash;Among the <i>Teleostei</i>, or bony fishes,
those which first appear in geological history are the <i>Isospondyli</i>,
the allies of the salmon and herring. These have all numerous
vertebr&aelig;, small in size, and none of them in any notable degree
modified or specialized. They abound in the depths of the
ocean, but there are comparatively few of them in the tropics.
The <i>Salmonid&aelig;</i> which inhabit the rivers and lakes of the northern
zones have from 60 to 65 vertebr&aelig;. The <i>Myctophid&aelig;,
Stomiatid&aelig;</i>, and other deep-sea forms have from 40 upwards
in the few species in which the number has been counted.
The group of <i>Clupeid&aelig;</i> is nearer the primitive stock of
<i>Isospondyli</i> than the salmon are. This group is essentially
northern in its distribution, but a considerable number of its
members are found within the tropics. The common herring
(<i>Clupea harangus</i>) ranges farther into the arctic regions than
any other. Its vertebr&aelig; are 56 in number. In the shad (<i>Alosa
sapidissima</i>), a northern species which ascends the rivers, the
same number is recorded. The sprat (<i>Clupea sprattus</i>) and
sardine (<i>Sardinia pilchardus</i>), ranging farther south, have from
48 to 50, while in certain small herrings (<i>Sardinella</i>) which are
strictly confined to tropical shores the number is but 40. Allied
to the herring are the anchovies, mostly tropical. The northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>most
species, the common anchovy of Europe (<i>Engraulis enchrasicolus</i>),
has 46 vertebr&aelig;. A tropical species (<i>Anchovia browni</i>)
has 41.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few soft-rayed fishes confined to the
tropical seas in which the numbers of vertebr&aelig; are still large,
an exception to the general rule. Among these are <i>Albula vulpes</i>,
the bonefish, with 70 vertebr&aelig;, <i>Elops saurus</i>, the ten-pounder,
with 72, the tarpon (<i>Tarpon atlanticus</i>), with about 50, and the
milkfish, <i>Chanos chanos</i>, with 72.</p>

<p>In a fossil Eocene herring from the Green River shales (<i>Diplomystus</i>)
I count 40 vertebr&aelig;; in a bass-like fish (<i>Mioplosus</i>)
from the same locality 24&mdash;these being the usual numbers in
the present tropical members of these groups.</p>

<p>The great family of <i>Silurid&aelig;</i>, or catfishes, is represented in all
the fresh waters of temperate and tropical America, as well as in
the warmer parts of the Old World. One division of the family,
containing numerous species, abounds on the sandy shores of
the tropical seas. The others are all fresh-water fishes. So
far as the vertebr&aelig; in the <i>Silurid&aelig;</i> have been examined, no
conclusions can be drawn. The vertebr&aelig; in the marine species
range from 35 to 50; in the North American forms, from 37 to 45;
and in the South American fresh-water species, where there is
almost every imaginable variation in form and structure, the
numbers range from 28 to 50 or more. The <i>Cyprinid&aelig;</i> (carp
and minnows), confined to the fresh waters of the northern hemisphere,
and their analogues, the <i>Characinid&aelig;</i> of the rivers of
South America and Africa, have also numerous vertebr&aelig;, 36 to
50 in most cases.</p>

<p>In general we may say of the soft-rayed fishes that very
few of them are inhabitants of tropical shores. Of these few,
some which are closely related to northern forms have fewer
vertebr&aelig; than their cold-water analogues. In the northern
species, the fresh-water species, and the species found in the deep
sea the number of vertebr&aelig; is always large, but the same is
true of some of the tropical species also.</p>

<p><b>The Flounders.</b>&mdash;In the flounders, the halibut and its relatives,
arctic genera (<i>Hippoglossus</i> and <i>Atheresthes</i>), have from
49 to 50 vertebr&aelig;. The northern genera (<i>Hippoglossoides,
Lyopsetta</i>, and <i>Eopsetta</i>) have from 43 to 45; the members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
a large semi-tropical genus (<i>Paralichthys</i>) of wide range have
from 35 to 41; while the tropical forms have from 35 to 37.</p>

<p>In the group of turbots and whiffs none of the species really
belong to the northern fauna, and the range in numbers is from
35 to 43. The highest number, 43, is found in a deep-water
species (<i>Monolene</i>), and the next, 40, in species (<i>Lepidorhombus,
Orthopsetta</i>) which extend their range well toward the north.
Among the plaices, which are all northern, the numbers range
from 35 to 65, the higher numbers, 52, 58, 65, being found in
species (<i>Glyptocephalus</i>) which inhabit considerable depths in
the arctic seas. The lowest numbers (35) belong to shore
species (<i>Pleuronichthys</i>) which range well toward the south.</p>

<p><b>Spiny-rayed Fishes.</b>&mdash;Among the spiny-rayed fishes the facts
are more striking. Of these, numerous families are chiefly or
wholly confined to the tropics, and in the great majority of
all the species the number of vertebr&aelig; is constantly 24,&mdash;10 in
the body and 14 in the tail (10+14). This is true of all or
nearly all the <i>Berycid&aelig;</i>, <i>Serranid&aelig;</i>, <i>Sparid&aelig;</i>, <i>Sci&aelig;nid&aelig;</i>, <i>Ch&aelig;todontid&aelig;</i>,
<i>H&aelig;mulid&aelig;</i>, <i>Gerrid&aelig;</i>, <i>Gobiid&aelig;</i>, <i>Acanthurid&aelig;</i>, <i>Mugilid&aelig;</i>,
<i>Sphyr&aelig;nid&aelig;</i>, <i>Mullid&aelig;</i>, <i>Pomacentrid&aelig;</i>, etc.</p>

<p>In some families in which the process of reduction has gone
on to an extreme degree, as in certain <i>Plectognath</i> fishes, there
has been a still further reduction, the lowest number, 14, existing
in the short inflexible body of the trunkfish (<i>Ostracion</i>), in
which the vertebral joints are movable only in the base of the
tail. In all these forms the process of reduction of vertebr&aelig;
has been accompanied by specialization in other respects. The
range of distribution of these fishes is chiefly though not quite
wholly confined to the tropics.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Balistes</i>, the trigger-fish, has 17 vertebr&aelig;; <i>Monacanthus</i>
and <i>Alutera</i>, foolfishes, about 20; the trunkfish, <i>Ostracion</i>, 14;
the puffers, <i>Tetraodon</i> and <i>Spheroides</i>, 18; <i>Canthigaster</i>, 17;
and the headfish, <i>Mola</i>, 17. Among the <i>Pediculates, Malthe</i>
and <i>Antennarius</i> have 17 to 19 vertebr&aelig;, while in their near
relatives, the anglers, <i>Lophiid&aelig;</i>, the number varies with the
latitude. Thus, in the northern angler, <i>Lophius piscatorius</i>,
which is never found south of Cape Hatteras, there are 30 vertebr&aelig;.
In a similar species, inhabiting the north of Japan (<i>Lophius
litulon</i>), there are 27. In another Japanese species, ranging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
farther south, <i>Lophiomus setigerus</i>, the vertebr&aelig; are but 19.
Yet in external appearance these two fishes are almost identical.
It is, however, a notable fact that some of the deep-water
<i>Pediculates</i>, or angling fishes, have the body very short and the
number of vertebr&aelig; correspondingly reduced. <i>Dibranchus atlanticus</i>,
from a depth of 3600 fathoms, or more than 4 miles, has
but 18 vertebr&aelig;, and others of its relatives in deep waters show
also small numbers. These soft-bodied fishes are simply animated
mouths, with a feeble osseous structure, and they are
perhaps recent offshoots from some stock which has extended
its range from muddy bottom or from floating seaweed to the
depths of the sea.</p>

<p>A very few spiny-rayed families are wholly confined to the
northern seas. One of the most notable of these is the family
of viviparous surf-fishes (<i>Embiotocid&aelig;</i>), of which numerous species
abound on the coasts of California and Japan, but which enter
neither the waters of the frigid nor of the torrid zone. The surf-fishes
have from 32 to 42 vertebr&aelig;, numbers which are never
found among tropical fishes of similar appearance or relationship.</p>

<p>The facts of variation with latitude were first noticed among
the <i>Labrid&aelig;</i>. In the northern genera (<i>Labrus</i>, <i>Tautoga</i>, etc.)
there are 38 to 41 vertebr&aelig;; in the semi-tropical genera (<i>Crenilabrus</i>,
<i>Bodianus</i>, etc.), 30 to 33; in the tropical genera (<i>Halich&oelig;res</i>,
<i>Xyrichthys</i>, <i>Thalassoma</i>, etc.), usually 24.</p>

<p>Equally striking are the facts in the great group of <i>Pareioplit&aelig;</i>,
or mailed-cheek fishes, composed of numerous families,
diverging from each other in various respects, but agreeing in
certain peculiarities of the skeleton.</p>

<p>Among these fishes the family most nearly related to ordinary
fishes is that of the <i>Scorp&aelig;nid&aelig;</i> (scorpion-fishes, etc.).</p>

<p>This is a large family containing many species, fishes of local
habits, swarming about the rocks at moderate depths in all
zones. The species of the tropical genera have all 24 vertebr&aelig;.
Those genera chiefly found in cooler waters, as in California,
Japan, Chile, and the Cape of Good Hope, have in all their species
27 vertebr&aelig;, while in the arctic genera there are 31.</p>

<p>Allied to the <i>Scorp&aelig;nid&aelig;</i>, but confined to the tropical or
semi-tropical seas, are the <i>Platycephalid&aelig;</i>, with 27 vertebr&aelig;, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the <i>Cephalacanthid&aelig;</i> (flying gurnards), with but 22. In the
deeper waters of the tropics are the <i>Peristediid&aelig;</i>, with 33 vertebr&aelig;,
and extending farther north, belonging as much to the temperate
as to the torrid zone, is the large family of the <i>Triglid&aelig;</i> (gurnards)
in which the vertebr&aelig; range from 25 to 38.</p>

<p>The family of <i>Agonid&aelig;</i> (sea-poachers), with 36 to 40 vertebr&aelig;,
is still more decidedly northern in its distribution. Wholly confined
to northern waters is the great family of the <i>Cottid&aelig;</i> (sculpins),
in which the vertebr&aelig; ascend from 30 to 50. Entirely
polar and often in deep waters are the <i>Liparidid&aelig;</i> (sea-snails),
an offshoot from the <i>Cottid&aelig;</i>, with soft, limp bodies, and the
vertebr&aelig; 35 to 65. In these northern forms there are no scales,
the spines in the fins have practically disappeared, and only
the anatomy shows that they belong to the group of spiny-rayed
fishes. In the <i>Cyclopterid&aelig;</i> (lumpfishes), likewise largely arctic,
the body becomes short and thick, the back-bone inflexible,
and the vertebr&aelig; are again reduced to 28. In most cases, as
the number of vertebr&aelig; increases, the body becomes proportionally
elongate. As a result of this, the fishes of arctic waters
are, for the most part, long and slender, and not a few of them
approach the form of eels. In the tropics, however, while
elongate fishes are common enough, most of them (always excepting
the eels) have the normal number of vertebr&aelig;, the greater
length being due to the elongation of their individual vertebr&aelig;
and not to their increase in number. Thus the very slender goby,
<i>Gobionellus oceanicus</i>, has the same number (25) of vertebr&aelig; as its
thick-set relative <i>Gobius soporator</i> or the chubby <i>Lophogobius
cyprinoides</i>. In the great group of blenny-like fishes the facts
are equally striking. The arctic species are very slender in form
as compared with the tropical blennies, and this fact, caused by
a great increase in the number of their vertebr&aelig;, has led to the
separation of the group into several families. The tropical forms
composing the family of <i>Blenniid&aelig;</i> have from 28 to 49 vertebr&aelig;,
while in the arctic genera the numbers range from 75 to 100.</p>

<p>Of the true <i>Blennid&aelig;</i>, which are all tropical or semi-tropical,
<i>Blennius</i> has 28 to 35 vertebr&aelig;; <i>Salarias</i>, 35 to 38; Lepisoma,
34; <i>Clinus</i>, 49; <i>Cristiceps</i>, 40. A fresh-water species of <i>Cristiceps</i>
found in Australia has 46. Blennioid fishes in the arctic
seas are <i>Anarrhichas</i>, with 76 vertebr&aelig;; <i>Anarrhichthys</i>, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
100 or more; <i>Lumpenus</i>, 79; <i>Pholis</i>, 85; <i>Lycodes</i>, 112; <i>Gymnelis</i>,
93. <i>Lycodes</i> and <i>Gymnelis</i> have lost all the dorsal spines.</p>

<p>In the cod family (<i>Gadid&aelig;</i>) the number of vertebr&aelig; is usually
about 50. The number is 51 in the codfish (<i>Gadus callarias</i>),
58 in the Siberian cod (<i>Eleginus navaga</i>), 54 in the haddock
(<i>Melanogrammus &aelig;glifinus</i>), 54 in the whiting (<i>Merlangus merlangus</i>),
54 in the coalfish (<i>Pollachius virens</i>), 52 in the Alaskan
coalfish (<i>Theragra chalcogramma</i>), 51 in the hake (<i>Merluccius
merluccius</i>). In the burbot (<i>Lota lota</i>), the only fresh-water
codfish, 59; in the deep-water ling (<i>Molva molva</i>), 64; in the
rocklings (<i>Gaidropsarus</i>), 47 to 49. Those few species found
in the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Mexico have fewer fin-rays
and probably fewer vertebr&aelig; than the others, but none of the
family enter warm water, the southern species living at greater
depths.</p>

<p>In the deep-sea allies of the codfishes, the grenadiers or
rat-tails (<i>Macrourid&aelig;</i>), the numbers range from 65 to 80.</p>

<p><b>Fresh-water Fishes.</b>&mdash;Of the families confined strictly to
the fresh waters the great majority are among the soft-rayed or
physostomous fishes, the allies of the salmon, pike, carp, and
catfish. In all of these the vertebr&aelig; are numerous. A few
fresh-water families have their affinities entirely with the more
specialized forms of the tropical seas. Of these the <i>Centrarchid&aelig;</i>
(comprising the American fresh-water sunfish and black bass)
have on the average about 30 vertebr&aelig;, the pirate perch 29,
and the <i>Percid&aelig;</i>, perch and darters, etc., 35 to 45, while the
<i>Serranid&aelig;</i> or sea-bass, the nearest marine relatives of all these,
have constantly 24. The marine family of damsel-fishes (<i>Pomacentrid&aelig;</i>)
have 26 vertebr&aelig;, while 30 to 40 vertebr&aelig; usually
exist in their fresh-water analogues (or possibly descendants),
the <i>Cichlid&aelig;</i>, of the rivers of South America and Africa. The
sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteid&aelig;</i>), a family of spiny fishes, confined
to the rivers and seas of the north, have from 31 to 41 vertebr&aelig;.</p>

<p><b>Pelagic Fishes.</b>&mdash;Among the free-swimming or migratory
pelagic fishes, the number of vertebr&aelig; is usually greater than
among their relatives of local habits. This fact is most evident
among the scombriform fishes, the allies of the mackerel and
tunny. All of these belong properly to the warm seas, and the
reduction of the vertebr&aelig; in certain forms has no evident rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>tion
to the temperature, though it seems to be related in some
degree to the habits of the species. Perhaps the retention of
many segments is connected with that strength and swiftness
in the water for which the mackerels are preeminent.</p>

<p>The variations in the number of vertebr&aelig; in this group led
Dr. G&uuml;nther to divide it into two families, the <i>Carangid&aelig;</i> and
<i>Scombrid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Carangid&aelig;</i> or <i>Pampanos</i> are tropical shore fishes, local
or migratory to a slight degree. All these have from 24 to
26 vertebr&aelig;. In their pelagic relatives, the dolphins (<i>Coryph&aelig;na</i>),
there are from 30 to 33; in the opah (<i>Lampris</i>), 45; in
Brama, 42; while the great mackerel family (<i>Scombrid&aelig;</i>), all
of whose members are more or less pelagic, have from 31 to 50.</p>

<p>The mackerel (<i>Scomber scombrus</i>) has 31 vertebr&aelig;; the chub
mackerel (<i>Scomber japonicus</i>), 31; the tunny (<i>Thunnus thynnus</i>),
39; the long-finned albacore (<i>Germo alalonga</i>), 40; the bonito
(<i>Sarda sarda</i>), 50; the Spanish mackerel (<i>Scomberomorus maculatus</i>),
45.</p>

<p>Other mackerel-like fishes are the cutlass-fishes (<i>Trichiurid&aelig;</i>),
which approach the eels in form and in the reduction of the fins.
In these the vertebr&aelig; are correspondingly numerous, the numbers
ranging from 100 to 160. <i>Aphanopus</i> has 101 vertebr&aelig;;
<i>Lepidopus</i>, 112; <i>Trichurus</i>, 159.</p>

<p>In apparent contradiction to this rule, however, the pelagic
family of swordfishes (<i>Xiphias</i>), remotely allied to the mackerels,
and with even greater powers of swimming, has the vertebr&aelig;
in normal number, the common swordfish having but 24.</p>

<p><b>The Eels.</b>&mdash;The eels constitute a peculiar group of soft-rayed
ancestry, in which everything else has been subordinated to
muscularity and flexibility of body. The fins, girdles, gill-arches,
scales, and membrane bones are all imperfectly developed
or wanting. The eel is perhaps as far from the primitive stock
as the most highly "ichthyized" fishes, but its progress has
been of another character. The eel would be regarded in the
ordinary sense as a degenerate type, for its bony structure is
greatly simplified as compared with its ancestral forms, but in
its eel-like qualities it is, however, greatly specialized. All
the eels have vertebr&aelig; in great numbers. As the great majority
of the species are tropical, and as the vertebr&aelig; in very few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the deep-sea forms have been counted, no conclusions can
be drawn as to the relation of their vertebr&aelig; to the temperature.</p>

<p>It is evident that the two families most decidedly tropical
in their distribution, the morays (<i>Mur&aelig;nid&aelig;</i>) and the snake-eels
(<i>Ophichthyid&aelig;</i>), have diverged farthest from the primitive stock.
They are most "degenerate," as shown by the reduction of their
skeleton. At the same time they are also most decidedly "eel-like,"
and in some respects, as in coloration, dentition, muscular
development, most highly specialized. It is evident that the
presence of numerous vertebral joints is essential to the suppleness
of body which is the eel's chief source of power.</p>

<p>So far as known the numbers of vertebr&aelig; in eels range from
115 to 160, some of the deep-sea eels (<i>Nemichthys</i>, <i>Nettastoma</i>,
<i>Gordiichthys</i>) having much higher numbers, in accord with
their slender or whip-like forms.</p>

<p>Among the morays, <i>Mur&aelig;na helena</i> has 140; <i>Gymnothorax
meleagris</i>, 120; <i>G. undulatus</i>, 130; <i>G. moringa</i>, 145; <i>G. concolor</i>,
136; <i>Echidna catenata</i>, 116; <i>E. nebulosa</i>, 142; <i>E. zebra</i>, 135.
In other families the true eel, <i>Anguilla anguilla</i>, has 115; the
conger-eel, <i>Leptocephalus conger</i>, 156; and <i>Mur&aelig;nesox cinereus</i>,
154.</p>

<p><b>Variations in Fin-rays.</b>&mdash;In some families the number of
rays in the dorsal and anal fins is dependent on the number of
vertebr&aelig;. It is therefore subject to the same fluctuations.
This relation is not strictly proportionate, for often a variable
number of rays with their interspinal processes will be interposed
between a pair of vertebr&aelig;. The myotomes or muscular
bands on the sides are usually coincident with the number of
vertebr&aelig;. As, however, these and other characters are dependent
on differences in vertebral segmentation, they bear
the same relations to temperature or latitude that the vertebr&aelig;
themselves sustain.</p>

<p>Thus in the <i>Scorp&aelig;nid&aelig;</i>, <i>Sebastes</i>, and <i>Sebastolobus</i> arctic
genera have the dorsal rays xv, 13, the vertebr&aelig; 12+19. The
tropical genus <i>Scorp&aelig;na</i> has the dorsal rays xii, 10, the vertebr&aelig;
10+14, while the genus <i>Sebastodes</i> of temperate waters
has the intermediate numbers of dorsal rays xii, 12, and vertebr&aelig;
12+15.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Relation of Numbers to Conditions of Life.</b>&mdash;Fresh-water fishes
have in general more vertebr&aelig; than marine fishes of shallow
waters. Pelagic fishes and deep-sea fishes have more than
those which live along the shores, and more than localized or
non-migratory forms. To each of these generalizations there
are occasional partial exceptions, but not such as to invalidate
the rule.</p>

<p>The presence of large numbers of vertebr&aelig; is noteworthy
among those fishes which swim for long distances, as, for example,
many of the mackerel family. Among such there is often found
a high grade of muscular power, or even of activity, associated
with a large number of vertebr&aelig;, these vertebr&aelig; being individually
small and little differentiated. For long-continued muscular
action of a uniform kind there would be perhaps an advantage
in the low development of the vertebral column. For
muscular alertness, moving short distances with great speed,
the action of a fish constantly on its guard against enemies or
watching for its prey, the advantage would be on the side of a
few vertebr&aelig;. There is often a correlation between the free-swimming
habit and slenderness and suppleness of the body,
which again is often dependent on an increase in numbers of
the vertebral segments. These correlations appear as a disturbing
element in the problem rather than as furnishing a
clew to its solution. In some groups of fresh-water fishes there
is a reduction in number of vertebr&aelig;, not associated with any
degree of specialization of the individual bone, but correlated
with simple reduction in size of body. This is apparently a
phenomenon of degeneration, a survival of dwarfs, where conditions
are unfavorable in full growth.</p>

<p>All these effects should be referable to the same group of
causes. They may, in fact, be combined in one statement. All
other fishes now extant, as well as all fishes existing prior to
Cretaceous times, have a larger number of vertebr&aelig; than the
marine shore fishes of the tropics of the present period. There
is good reason to believe that in most groups of spiny-rayed
fishes, those with the smaller number of segments are at once
the most highly organized and the most primitive. This is true
among the blennies, the sculpins, the flounders, the perches, and
probably the labroid fishes as well. The present writer once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
held the contrary view, that the forms with the higher numbers
were primitive, but the evidence both from comparative anatomy
and from pal&aelig;ontology seems to indicate that among spiny-rayed
fishes the forms most ancient, most generalized, and most
synthetic are those with about 24 vertebr&aelig;. The soft-rayed
fishes without exception show larger numbers, and these are
still more primitive. This apparent contradiction is perhaps
explained by Dr. Boulenger's suggestion that the prevalence of
the same number, 24, in the vertebr&aelig; of various families of spiny-rayed
fishes is due to common descent, probably from Cretaceous
berycoids having this number. In this theory, perches, sparoids,
carangoids, ch&aelig;todonts, labroids, parrot-fishes, gobies,
flounders, and sculpins must be regarded as having a common
origin from which all have diverged since Jurassic times.
This view is not at all unlikely and is not inconsistent with the
facts of pal&aelig;ontology. If this be the case, the members of these
and related families which have larger numbers of vertebr&aelig;
must have diverged from the primitive stock. The change has
been one of degeneration, the individual vertebr&aelig; being reduced
in size and complexity, with a vegetative increase in their number.
At the same time, the body having the greater number of
segments is the more flexible though the segments themselves
are less specialized.</p>

<p>The primitive forms live chiefly along tropical shores, while
forms with increased numbers of vertebr&aelig; are found in all other
localities. This fact must be considered in any hypothesis as
to the causes producing such changes. If the development of
large numbers be a phase of degeneration the causes of such
degeneration must be sought in the colder seas, in the rivers, and
in the oceanic abysses. What have these waters in common
that the coral reefs, the lava crags, and tide-pools of the tropics
have not?</p>

<p>It is certain that the possession of fewer vertebr&aelig; indicates
the higher rank, the greater specialization of parts, even though
the many vertebr&aelig; be a feature less primitive. The evolution
of fishes is rarely a movement of progress toward complexity.
The time movement in some groups is accompanied by degradation
and loss of parts, by vegetative repetition of structures,
and often by a movement from the fish-form toward the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>eel-form.
Water life is less exacting than land life, having less variation
of conditions. It is, therefore, less effective in pushing
forward the differentiation of parts. When vertebr&aelig; are few
in number each one is relatively larger, its structure is more
complicated, its appendages larger and more useful, and the fins
with which it is connected are better developed. In other words,
the tropical fish is more intensely and compactly a fish, with a
better fish equipment, and in all ways better fitted for the business
of a fish, especially for that of a fish that stays at home.</p>

<p>In the center of competition no species can afford to be
handicapped by a weak back-bone and redundant vertebr&aelig;.
Those who are thus weighted cannot hold their own. They
must change or perish.</p>

<p>The conditions most favorable to fish life are among the rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
and reefs of the tropical seas. About the coral reefs is the center
of fish competition. A coral archipelago is the Paris of fishes.
In such regions is found the greatest variety of surroundings,
and therefore the greatest number of possible adjustments.
The struggle is between fish and fish, not between fishes and
hard conditions of life. No form is excluded from the competition.
Cold, darkness, and foul water do not shut out competitors,
nor does any evil influence sap the strength. The
heat of the tropics does not make the sea-water hot. It is
never sultry or laden with malaria.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_215.jpg" width="700" height="258" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 157.</span>&mdash;Skeleton of the Cowfish, <i>Lactophrys tricornis</i> (Linn&aelig;us).</p></div>
</div>

<p>From conditions otherwise favorable in arctic regions the
majority of competitors are excluded by their inability to bear
the cold. River life is life in isolation. To aquatic animals
river life has the same limitations that island life has to the
animals of the land. The oceanic islands are far behind the
continents in the process of evolution in so far as evolution implies
specialization of parts. In a like manner the rivers are
ages behind the seas, so far as progress is concerned, though
through lack of competition the animals in isolation may be
farthest from the original stock.</p>

<p>Therefore the influences which serve as a whole to intensify
fish life, to keep it up to its highest effectiveness, and which
tend to rid the fish of every character or structure it cannot
"use in its business," are most effective along the shores of the
tropics. One phase of this is the retention of low numbers of
vertebr&aelig;, or, more accurately, the increase of stress on each
individual bone.</p>

<p>Conversely, as the causes of these changes are still in opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>tion,
we should find that in cold waters, deep waters, dark
waters, fresh waters, and inclosed waters the strain would be
less, the relapses to less complex organization more frequent,
the numbers of vertebr&aelig; would be larger, while the individual
vertebr&aelig; would become smaller, less complete, and less perfectly
ossified.</p>

<p>This in a general way is precisely what we do find in examining
the skeletons of a large variety of fishes.</p>

<p>The cause of the increased numbers of vertebr&aelig; in cold waters
or extratropical waters is as yet unknown. Several guesses have
been made, but these can scarcely rise to the level of theories.
To ascribe it to natural selection, as the present writer has done,
is to do little more than to restate the problem.</p>

<p>As a possible tentative hypothesis we may say that the
retention of the higher primitive traits in the tropics is due to
continuous selection, the testing of individuals by the greater
variety of external conditions. The degeneration of extratropical
fishes may be due to isolation and cessation or reversal
of selection. Thus fresh waters, the arctic waters, the oceanic
abysses are the "back woods" of fish life, localities favorable
to the retention of primitive simplicity, equally favorable
to subsequent degeneration. Practically all deep-sea fishes are
degenerate descendants of shore fishes of various groups. Monotony
and isolation permit or encourage degeneration of type.
Where the struggle for existence is most intense the higher structures
will be retained or developed. Among such facts as these
derived from natural selection the cause of the relation of temperature
to number of vertebr&aelig; must be sought. How the
Cretaceous berycoids first acquired their few vertebr&aelig; and the
high degree of individual specialization of these structures we
may not know. The character came with the thoracic ventrals
with reduced number of rays, the ctenoid scales, the toothless
maxillary, and other characters which have long persisted in
their subsequent descendants.</p>

<p>An exception to the general rule in regard to the number of
vertebr&aelig; is found in the case of the eel. Eels inhabit nearly all
seas, and everywhere they have many vertebr&aelig;. The eels of
the tropics are at once more specialized and more degraded.
They are better eels than those of northern regions, but, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
eel is a degraded type, they have gone farther in the loss of
structures in which this degradation consists.</p>

<p>It is not well to push this analogy too far, but perhaps we
can find in the comparison of the tropics and the cities some
suggestion as to the development of the eel.</p>

<p>In the city there is always a class which follows in no degree
the general line of development. Its members are specialized
in a wholly different way. By this means they take to themselves
a field which others have neglected, making up in low
cunning what they lack in humanity or intelligence.</p>

<p>Thus, among fishes, we have in the regions of closest competition
this degenerate and non-fish-like type, lurking in holes
among the rocks, or creeping in the sand; thieves and scavengers
among fishes. The eels thus fill a place otherwise left unfilled.
In their way they are perfectly adapted to the lives
they lead. A multiplicity of vertebral joints is useless to the
tropical fish, but to the eel strength and suppleness are everything.
No armature of fin or scale or bone is so desirable as
its power of escaping through the smallest opening. With the
elongation of the body and its increase in flexibility there is a
tendency toward the loss of the paired fins, the ventrals going
first, and afterwards the pectorals. This tendency may be seen
in many groups. Among recent fishes, the blennies, the eel-pouts,
and the sea-snails furnish illustrative examples.</p>

<p><b>Degeneration of Structures.</b>&mdash;In the lancelet, which is a
primitively simple organism, the various structures of the body
are formed of simple tissues and in a very simple fashion. It is
probable from the structure of each of these that it has never
been very much more complex. As the individual develops in the
process of growth each organ goes as it were straight to its final
form and structure without metamorphosis or especial alterations
by the way. When this type of development occurs, the organism
belongs to a type which is primitively simple. But there are
other forms which in their adult state appear feeble or simple, in
which are found elements of organs of high complexity. Thus
in the sea-snail (<i>Liparis</i>), small, weak, with feeble fins and flabby
skin, we find the essential anatomy of the sculpin or the rosefish.
The organs of the latter are there, but each one is reduced
or degenerate, the bones as soft as membranes, the spines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
obsolete or buried in the skin. Such a type is said to be degenerate.
It is very different from one primitively simple, and
it is likely in its earlier stages of development to be more complex
than when it is fully grown.</p>

</div>

<p>In the evolution of groups of fishes it is a common feature
that some one organ will be the center of a special stress, in
view of some temporary importance of its function. By the
process of natural selection it will become highly developed and
highly specialized. Some later changes in conditions will ren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>der
this specialization useless or even harmful for at least a part
of the species possessing it. The structure then undergoes degeneration,
and in many cases it is brought to a lower estate than
before the original changes. An example of this may be taken
from the loricate or mailed-cheek fishes. One of the primitive
members of this group is the rockfish known as priestfish (<i>Sebastodes
mystinus</i>). In this fish the head is weakly armed, covered
with ordinary scales. A slight suggestion of cranial ridges
and a slight prolongation of the third suborbital constitute the
chief suggestions of its close affinity with the mailed-cheek
fishes. In other rockfishes the cranial ridges grow higher and
sharper. The third suborbital extends itself farther and wider.
It becomes itself spinous in still others. Finally it covers the
whole cheek in a coat of mail. The head above becomes rough
and horny and at last the whole body also is enclosed in a bony
box. But while this specialization reaches an extraordinary
degree in forms like <i>Agonus</i> and <i>Peristedion</i>, it begins to abate
with <i>Cottus</i>, and thence through <i>Cottunculus</i>, <i>Psychrolutes</i>, <i>Liparis</i>,
and the like, and the mailed cheek finds its final degradation
in <i>Parliparis</i>. In this type no spines are present anywhere,
no hard bone, no trace of scales, of first dorsal, or of
ventral fins, and in the soft, limp structure covered with a
fragile, scarf-like skin we find little suggestion of affinity
with the strong rockfish or the rough-mailed <i>Agonus</i>. Yet
a study of the skeleton shows that all these loricate forms
constitute a continuous divergent series. The forms figured constitute
only a few of the stages of specialization and degradation
which the members of this group represent.</p>

<p>The degeneration of the eye of the blind fishes of the caves
of the Mississippi Valley, <i>Amblyopsis</i>, <i>Typhlichthys</i>, and <i>Troglichthys</i>,
have been very fully studied by Dr. Carl H. Eigenmann.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>According to his observations</p>

<p>"The history of the eye of <i>Amblyopsis spel&aelig;us</i> may be divided
into four periods:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_221-163.jpg" width="600" height="203" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 163.</span>&mdash;Sleek Sculpin, <i>Psychrolutes paradoxus</i> (G&uuml;nther). Puget Sound.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"(<i>a</i>) The first extends from the appearance of the eye till
the embryo is 4-5 mm. long. This period is characterized by
a normal palingenic development, except that the cell division
is retarded and there is very little growth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>

<p>"(<i>b</i>) The second period extends till the fish is 10 mm. long.
It is characterized by the direct development of the eye from
the normal embryonic stage reached in the first period to the
highest stage reached by the <i>Amblyopsis</i> eye.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>

<p>"(<i>c</i>) The third, from 10 mm. to about 80 or 100 mm. It is
characterized by a number of changes which are positive as con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>trasted
with degenerative. There are also distinct degenerative
processes taking place during this period.</p>

<p>"(<i>d</i>) The fourth, 80-100 mm. to death. It is characterized
by degenerative processes only.</p>

<p>"The eye of <i>Amblyopsis</i> appears at the same stage of growth
as in normal fishes developing normal eyes. The eye grows but
little after its appearance.</p>

<p>"All the developmental processes are retarded and some of
them give out prematurely. The most important, if the last, is
the cell division and the accompanying growth that provide
material for the eye.</p>

<p>"The lens appears at the normal time and in the normal way,
but its cells never divide and never lose their embryonic character.</p>

<p>"The lens is first to show degenerative steps and disappears
entirely before the fish is 10 mm. long.</p>

</div>

<p>"The optic nerve appears shortly before the fish reaches 5
mm. It does not increase in size with the growth of the fish
and disappears in old age.</p>

<p>"The scleral cartilages appear when the fish is 10 mm. long;
they grow very slowly, possibly till old age.</p>

<p>"There is no constant ratio between the extent and degree
of ontogenic and phylogenic degeneration.</p>

<p>"The eye is approaching the vanishing point through the
route indicated by the eye of <i>Troglichthys ros&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>"There being no causes operative or inhibitive, either within
the fish or in the environment, that are not also operative or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
inhibitive in <i>Chologaster agassizii</i>, which lives in caves and
develops well-formed eyes, it is evident that the causes controlling
the development are hereditarily established in the egg
by an accumulation of such degenerative changes as are still
notable in the later history of the eye of the adult.</p>

<p>"The foundations of the eye are normally laid, but the
superstructure, instead of continuing the plan with additional
material, completes it out of the material provided for the
foundations. The development of the foundation of the eye is
phylogenic; the stages beyond the foundations are direct."</p>

<p><b>Conditions of Evolution among Fishes.</b>&mdash;Dr. Bashford Dean
("Fishes, Living and Fossil") has the following observations on
the processes of adaptation among fishes:</p>

<p>"The evolution of groups of fishes must accordingly have
taken place during only the longest periods of time. Their
aquatic life has evidently been unfavorable to deep-seated
structural changes, or at least has not permitted these to be
perpetuated. Recent fishes have diverged in but minor regards
from their ancestors of the Coal Measures. Within the same
duration of time, on the other hand, terrestrial vertebrates have
not only arisen, but have been widely differentiated. Among
land-living forms the amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals
have been evolved, and have given rise to more than sixty
orders.</p>

<p>"The evolution of fishes has been confined to a noteworthy
degree within rigid and unshifting bounds; their living medium,
with its mechanical effects upon fish-like forms and structures,
has for ages been almost constant in its conditions; its changes
of temperature and density and currents have rarely been more
than of local importance, and have influenced but little the
survival of genera and species widely distributed; its changes,
moreover, in the normal supply of food organisms cannot be
looked upon as noteworthy. Aquatic life has built few of
the direct barriers to survival, within which the terrestrial
forms appear to have been evolved by the keenest competition.</p>

<p>"It is not, accordingly, remarkable that in their descent
fishes are known to have retained their tribal features, and to
have varied from each other only in details of structure. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
evolution is to be traced in diverging characters that prove rarely
more than of family value; one form, as an example, may have
become adapted for an active and predatory life, evolving
stronger organs of progression, stouter armoring, and more
trenchant teeth; another, closely akin in general structures,
may have acquired more sluggish habits, largely or greatly diminished
size, and degenerate characters in its dermal investiture,
teeth and organs of sense or progression. The flowering
out of a series of fish families seems to have characterized every
geological age, leaving its clearest imprint on the forms which
were then most abundant. The variety that to-day maintains
among the families of bony fishes is thus known to be paralleled
among the carboniferous sharks, the Mesozoic Chim&aelig;roids, and
the Pal&aelig;ozoic lung-fishes and Teleostomes. Their environment
has retained their general characters, while modelling them
anew into forms armored or scaleless, predatory or defenseless,
great, small, heavy, stout, sluggish, light, slender, blunt, tapering,
depressed.</p>

<p>"When members of any group of fishes became extinct, those
appear to have been the first to perish which were the possessors
of the greatest number of widely modified or <i>specialized</i>
structures. Those, for example, whose teeth were adapted for
a particular kind of food, or whose motions were hampered by
ponderous size or weighty armoring, were the first to perish
in the struggle for existence; on the other hand, the forms
that most nearly retained the ancestral or tribal characters&mdash;that
is, those whose structures were in every way least extreme&mdash;were
naturally the best fitted to survive. Thus <i>generalized</i> fishes
should be considered those of medium size, medium defenses,
medium powers of progression, omnivorous feeding habits, and
wide distribution, and these might be regarded as having provided
the staples of survival in every branch of descent.</p>

<p>"Aquatic living has not demanded wide divergence from the
ancestral stem, and the divergent forms which may culminate
in a profusion of families, genera, and species do not appear to
be again productive of more generalized groups. In all lines of
descent specialized forms do not appear to regain by regression
or degeneration the potential characters of their ancestral condition.
A generalized form is like potter's clay, plastic in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
hands of nature, readily to be converted into a needed kind of
cup or vase; but when thus specialized may never resume unaltered
its ancestral condition: the clay survives; the cup perishes."

THE COLORS OF FISHES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_226.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Pigmentation</span>.</b>&mdash;The colors of fishes are in general produced
by oil sacs or pigment cells beneath the epidermis
or in some cases beneath the scales. Certain metallic
shades, silvery blue or iridescent, are produced, not by actual
pigment, but, as among insects, by the deflection of light from
the polished skin or the striated surfaces of the scales. Certain
fine striations give an iridescent appearance through the interference
of light.</p>

<p>The pigmentary colors may be divided into two general
classes, ground coloration and ornamentation or markings.
Of these the ground color is most subject to individual or local
variation, although usually within narrow limits, while the
markings are more subject to change with age or sex. On the
other hand, they are more distinctive of the species itself.</p>

<p><b>Protective Coloration.</b>&mdash;The ground coloration most usual
among fishes is protective in its nature. In a majority of fishes
the back is olivaceous or gray, either plain or mottled, and the
belly white. To birds looking down into the water, the back
is colored like the water itself or like the bottom below it. To
fishes in search of prey from below, the belly is colored like
the surface of the water or the atmosphere above it. In any
case the darker colored upper surface casts its shadow over
the paler lower parts.</p>

<p>In shallow waters or in rivers the bottom is not uniformly
colored. The fish, especially if it be one which swims close
to the bottom, is better protected if the olivaceous surface is
marked by darker cross streaks and blotches. These give the
fish a color resemblance to the weeds about it or to the sand
and stones on which it lies. As a rule, no fish which lies on
the bottom is ever quite uniformly colored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>In the open seas, where the water seems very blue, blue
colors, and especially metallic shades, take the place of olivaceous
gray or green. As we descend into deep water, especially
in the warm seas, red pigment takes the place of olive. At a
moderate depth a large percentage of the fishes are of various
shades of red. Several of the large groupers of the
West Indies are represented by two color forms, a shore
form in which the prevailing shade is olive-green, and a
deeper-water form which is crimson. In several cases an intermediate-color
form also exists which is lemon-yellow. On
the coast of California is a band-shaped blenny (<i>Apodichthys
flavidus</i>) which appears in three colors, according to its surroundings,
blood-red, grass-green, and olive-yellow. The red
coloration is also essentially protective, for the region inhabited
by such forms is the zone of the rose-red alg&aelig;. In the
arctic waters, and in lakes where rose-red alg&aelig; are not found,
the red-ground coloration is almost unknown, although red
may appear in markings or in nuptial colors. It is possible
that the red, both of fishes and alg&aelig;, in deeper water is related
to the effect of water on the waves of light, but whether this
should make fishes red or violet has never been clearly under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>stood.
It is true also that where the red in fishes ceases violet-black
begins.</p>

<p>In the greater depths, from 500 to 4000 fathoms, the ground
color in most fishes becomes deep black or violet-black, sometimes
with silvery luster reflected from the scales, but more usually
dull and lusterless. This shade may be also protective. In
these depths the sun's rays scarcely penetrate, and the fish and
the water are of the same apparent shade, for black coloration
is here the mere absence of light.</p>

<p>In general, the markings of various sorts grow less distinct
with the increase of depth. Bright-red fishes of the depths are
usually uniform red. The violet-black fishes of the oceanic
abysses show no markings whatever (luminous glands excepted),
and in deep waters there are no nuptial or sexual differences in
color.</p>

<p>Ground colors other than olive-green, gray, brown, or silvery
rarely appear among fresh-water fishes. Marine fishes in the
tropics sometimes show as ground color bright blue, grass-green,
crimson, orange-yellow, or black; but these showy colors
are almost confined to fishes of the coral reefs, where they are
often associated with elaborate systems of markings.</p>

<p><b>Protective Markings.</b>&mdash;The markings of fishes are of almost
every conceivable character. They may be roughly grouped
as protective coloration, sexual coloration, nuptial coloration,
recognition colors, and ornamentation, if we may use the latter
term for brilliant hues which serve no obvious purpose to the
fish itself.</p>

<p>Examples of protective markings may be seen everywhere.
The flounder which lies on the sand has its upper surface covered
with sand-like blotches, and these again will vary according
to the kind of sand it imitates. It may be true sand or crushed
coral or the detritus of lava, in any case perfectly imitated.</p>

<p>Equally closely will the markings on a fish correspond with
rock surroundings. With granite rocks we find an elaborate
series of granitic markings, with coral rocks another series of
shades, and if red corals be present, red shades of like appearance
are found on the fish. Still another kind of mark indicates
rock pools lined with the red calcareous alg&aelig; called corallina.
Black species are found in lava masses, grass-green ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
among the fronds of ulva, and olive-green among Sargassum
or fucus, the markings and often the form corresponding to the
nature of the alg&aelig; in which the species makes its home.</p>

<p><b>Sexual Coloration.</b>&mdash;In many groups of fishes the sexes are
differently colored. In some cases bright-red, blue, or black
markings characterize the male, the female having similar
marks, but less distinct, and the bright colors replaced by olive,
brown, or gray. In a few cases, however, the female has marks
of a totally different nature, and scarcely less bright than those
of the male.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Nuptial Coloration.</b>&mdash;Nuptial colors are those which appear
on the male in the breeding season only, the pigment afterwards
vanishing, leaving the sexes essentially alike. Such
colors are found on most of the minnows and dace (<i>Cyprinid&aelig;</i>)
of the rivers and to a less degree in some other fresh-water
fishes, as the darters (<i>Etheostomin&aelig;</i>) and the trout. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
minnows of many species the male in spring has the skin charged
with bright pigment, red, black, or bright silvery, for the most
part, the black most often on the head, the red on the head
and body, and the silvery on the tips of the fins. At the same
time other markings are intensified, and in many species the
head and sometimes the body and fins are covered with warty
excrescences. These shades are most distinct on the most vigorous
males, and disappear with the warty excrescences after the
fertilization of the eggs.</p>

</div>

<p>Nuptial colors do not often appear among marine fishes, and
in but few families are the sexes distinguishable by differences
in coloration.</p>

<p><b>Recognition-marks.</b>&mdash;Under the head of "recognition-marks"
may be grouped a great variety of special markings, which may
be conceived to aid the representatives of a given species to
recognize each other. That they actually serve this purpose is
a matter of theory, but the theory is plausible, and these markings
have much in common with the white tail feathers, scarlet
crests, colored wing patches, and other markings regarded as
recognition-marks among birds.</p>

<p>Among these are ocelli, black- or blue-ringed with white or
yellow, on various parts of the body; black spots on the dorsal
fin; black spots below or behind the eye; black, red, blue, or
yellow spots variously placed; cross-bars of red or black or green,
with or without pale edges; a blood-red fin or a fin of shining
blue among pale ones; a white edge to the tail; a yellow, blue,
or red streamer to the dorsal fin, a black tip to the pectoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
or ventral; a hidden spot of emerald in the mouth or in the
axil; an almost endless variety of sharply defined markings,
not directly protective, which serve as recognition-marks, if not
to the fish itself, certainly to the naturalist who studies it.</p>

<p>These marks shade off into an equally great variety for which
we can devise no better name than "ornamentation." Some
fishes are simply covered with brilliant spots or bars or reticulations,
their nature and variety baffling description, while no
useful purpose seems to be served by them, unless we stretch
still more widely the convenient theory of recognition-marks.</p>

<p>In many cases the markings change with age, certain bands,
stripes, or ocelli being characteristic of the young and gradually
disappearing. In such cases the same marks will be found
permanent in some related species of less differentiated coloration.
In such cases it is safe to regard them as ancestral.</p>

<p>In case of markings on the fins and of elaborate ornamentation
in general, it is best defined in the oldest and most vigorous
individuals, becoming intensified by degrees. The most brilliantly
colored fishes are found about the coral reefs. Here
may be found species of which the ground color is the most
intense blue, others are crimson, grass-green, lemon-yellow,
jet-black, and each with a great variety of contrasted markings.
The frontispiece of this volume shows a series of such
fishes drawn from nature from specimens taken in pools of the
great coral reef of Apia in Samoa. These colors are not protective.
The coral masses are mostly plain gray, and the fishes
which lie on the bottom are plain gray also. Nothing could
be more brilliant or varied than the hues of the free-swimming
fishes. What their cause or purpose may be, it is impossible to
say. It is certain that their intense activity and the ease with
which they can seek shelter in the coral masses enable them to
defy their enemies. Nature seems to riot in bright colors where
her creatures are not destroyed by their presence.</p>

<p><b>Intensity of Coloration.</b>&mdash;In general, coloration is most intense
and varied in certain families of the tropical shores, and
especially about coral reefs. But in brilliancy of individual
markings some fresh-water fishes are scarcely less notable,
especially the darters (<i>Etheostomin&aelig;</i>) and sunfishes (<i>Centrarchid&aelig;</i>)
of the streams of eastern North America. The bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
hues of these fresh-water fishes are, however, more or less concealed
in the water by the olivaceous markings and dark blotches
of the upper parts.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Coral-reef Fishes.</b>&mdash;The brilliantly colored fishes of the tropical
reefs seem, as already stated, to have no need of protective
coloration. They save themselves from their enemies
in most cases by excessive alertness and activity (<i>Ch&aelig;todon</i>,
<i>Pomacentrus</i>), or else by busying themselves in coral sand (<i>Julis
gaimard</i>), a habit more frequent than has been suspected.
Every large mass of branching coral is full of lurking fishes,
some of them often most brilliantly colored.</p>

<p><b>Fading of Pigments in Spirits.</b>&mdash;In the preservation of specimens
most red and blue pigments fade to whitish, and it requires
considerable care to interpret the traces which may be left of
red bands or blue markings. Yet some blue pigments are absolutely
permanent, and occasionally blood-red pigments persist
through all conditions. Black pigment seldom changes in
spirits, and olivaceous markings simply fade a little without
material alteration. It is an important part of the work of the
systematic ichthyologist to learn to interpret the traces of the
faded pigment left on specimens he may have occasion to examine.
In such cases it is more important to trace the markings
than to restore the ground color, as the ground color is
at once more variable with individuals and more constant in
large groups.</p>

<p><b>Variation in Pattern.</b>&mdash;Occasionally, however, a species is
found in which, other characters being constant, both ground
color and markings are subject to a remarkable range of variation.
In such cases the actual unity of the species is open to
serious question. The most remarkable case of such variation
known is found in a West Indian fish, the vaca, which bears
the incongruous name of <i>Hypoplectrus unicolor</i>. In the typical
vaca the body is orange with black marks and blue lines, the
fins checkered with orange and blue. In a second form the
body is violet, barred with black, the head with blue spots and
bands. In another form the blue on the head is wanting. In
still another the body is yellow and black, with blue on the
head only. In others the fins are plain orange, without checks,
and the body yellow, with or without blue stripes and spots, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
sometimes with spots of black or violet. In still others the body
may be pink or brown, or violet-black, the fins all yellow, part
black or all black. Finally, there are forms deep indigo-blue in
color everywhere, with cross bands of indigo-black, and these
again may have bars of deeper blue on the head or may lack
these altogether. I find, no difference among these fishes except
in color, and no way of accounting for the differences in
this regard.</p>

<p>Certain species of puffer (<i>Tetraodon setosus</i>, of Panama, and
<i>Tetraodon nigropunctatus</i>, of Polynesia) show similar remarkable
variations, being dark gray with white spots, but varying
to indigo-blue, lemon-yellow, or sometimes having coarse blotches
of either. Lemon-yellow varieties of several species are known,
and these may be due to a failure of pigment, a sort of semi-albinism.
True albinos, individuals wholly without pigment, are
rare among fishes. In some cases the markings, commonly
black, will be replaced by a deep crimson which does not fade
in alcohol. This change happens most frequently among the
<i>Scorp&aelig;nid&aelig;</i>. An example of this is shown in the frontispiece
of Volume II of this work. The Japanese okose or poison-fish
(<i>Inimicus</i>) is black and gray about lava-rocks. In deeper
water among red alg&aelig; it is bright crimson, the color not
fading in spirits, the markings remaining the same. In still
deeper water it is lemon-yellow.</p>

THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF FISHES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_237.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Zoogeography</span>.</b>&mdash;Under the head of distribution we
consider the facts of the actual location of species
of organisms on the surface of the earth and the
laws by which their location is governed. This constitutes
the subject-matter of the science of zoogeography. In physical
geography we may prepare maps of the earth or of any part of
it, these bringing to prominence the physical features of its
surface. Such maps show here a sea, there a plateau, here a
mountain chain, there a desert, a prairie, a peninsula, or an
island. In political geography the maps show their physical
features of the earth as related to the people who inhabit
them and the states or powers which receive or claim their
allegiance. In zoogeography the realms of the earth are considered
in relation to the species or tribes of animals which
inhabit them. Thus series of maps could be drawn representing
those parts of North America in which catfishes or trout or
sunfishes are found in the streams. In like manner the distribution
of any particular fish as the muskallonge or the yellow
perch could be shown on the map. The details of such a map
are very instructive, and their consideration at once raises a
series of questions as to the cause behind each fact. In science
it must be supposed that no fact is arbitrary or meaningless.
In the case of fishes the details of the method of diffusion of
species afford matters of deep interest. These are considered
in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>The dispersion of animals may be described as a matter of
space and time, the movement being continuous but modified
by barriers and other conditions of environment. The tendency
of recent studies in zoogeography has been to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the facts of present distribution as the result of conditions in
the past, thus correlating our present knowledge with the past
relations of land and water as shown through paleontology.
Dr. A. E. Ortmann well observes that "Any division of the
earth's surface into zoogeographical regions which starts
exclusively from the present distribution of animals without
considering its origin must always be unsatisfactory." We
must therefore consider the coast-lines and barriers of Tertiary
and earlier times as well as those of to-day to understand the
present distribution of fishes.</p>

<p><b>General Laws of Distribution.</b>&mdash;The general laws governing
the distribution of all animals are reducible to three very simple
propositions.</p>

<p>Each species of animal is found in every part of the earth
having conditions suitable for its maintenance, unless</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Its individuals have been unable to reach this region
through barriers of some sort; or,</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Having reached it, the species is unable to maintain
itself, through lack of capacity for adaptation, through severity
of competition with other forms, or through destructive conditions
of environment; or else,</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Having entered and maintained itself, it has become so
altered in the process of adaptation as to become a species distinct
from the original type.</p>

<p><b>Species Absent through Barriers.</b>&mdash;The absence from the Japanese
fauna of most European or American species comes under
the first head. The pike has never reached the Japanese lakes,
though the shade of the-lotus leaf in the many clear ponds
would suit its habits exactly. The grunt<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and porgies<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of
our West Indian waters have failed to cross the ocean and therefore
have no descendants in Europe or Asia.</p>

<p><b>Species Absent through Failure to Maintain Foothold.</b>&mdash;Of
species under (<i>b</i>), those who have crossed the seas and not found
lodgement, we have, in the nature of things, no record. Of the
existence of multitudes of estrays we have abundant evidence.
In the Gulf Stream off Cape Cod are every year taken many
young fishes belonging to species at home in the Bahamas and
which find no permanent place in the New England fauna. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>like fashion, young fishes from the tropics drift northward in the
Kuro Shiwo to the coasts of Japan, but never finding a permanent
breeding-place and never joining the ranks of the Japanese
fishes. But to this there have been, and will be, occasional
exceptions. Now and then one among thousands finds permanent
lodgement, and by such means a species from another
region will be added to the fauna. The rest disappear and
leave no trace. A knowledge of these currents and their influence
is eventual to any detailed study of the dispersion of
fishes.</p>

<p>The occurrence of the young of many shore fishes of the
Hawaiian Islands as drifting plankton at a considerable distance
from the shores has been lately discovered by Dr. Gilbert.
Each island is, in a sense, a "sphere of influence," affecting
the fauna of neighboring regions.</p>

<p><b>Species Changed through Natural Selection.</b>&mdash;In the third class,
that of species changed in the process of adaptation, most
insular forms belong. As a matter of fact, at some time or
another almost every species must be in this category, for isolation
is a source of the most potent elements in the initiation
and intensification of the minor differences which separate related
species. It is not the preservation of the most useful
features, but of those which actually existed in the ancestral
individuals, which distinguish such species. Natural selection
must include not only the process of the survival of the fittest,
but also the results of the survival of the existing. This means
the preservation through heredity of the traits not of the species
alone, but those of the actual individuals set apart to be the
first in the line of descent in a new environment. In hosts of
cases the persistence of characters rests not on any special usefulness
or fitness, but on the fact that individuals possessing
these characters have, at one time or another, invaded a certain
area and populated it. The principle of utility explains
survivals among competing structures. It rarely accounts for
qualities associated with geographical distribution.</p>

<p><b>Extinction of Species.</b>&mdash;The extinction of species may be
noted here in connection with their extension of range. Prof.
Herbert Osborn has recognized five different types of elimination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That extinction which comes from modification or progressive
evolution, a relegation to the past as the result of a
transmutation into more advanced forms. 2. Extinction from
changes of physical environment which outrun the powers of
adaptation. 3. The extinction which results from competition.
4. The extinction from extreme specialization and limitation
to special conditions the loss of which means extinction. 5.
Extinction as a result of exhaustion. As an illustration of No. 1,
we may take almost any species which has a cognate species on
the further side of some barrier or in the tertiary seas. Thus
the trout of the Twin Lakes in Colorado has acquired its present
characters in the place of those brought into the lake by its actual
ancestors. No. 2 is illustrated by the disappearance of East
Indian types (<i>Zanclus</i>, <i>Platax</i>, <i>Toxotes</i>, etc.) in Italy at the end of
the Eocene, perhaps for climatic reasons. Extinction through
competition is shown in the gradual disappearance of the Sacramento
perch (<i>Archoplitis interruptus</i>) after the invasion of the
river by catfish and carp. From extreme specialization certain
forms have doubtless disappeared, but no certain case of this
kind has been pointed out among fishes, unless this be the
cause of the disappearance of the Devonian mailed <i>Ostracophores</i>
and <i>Arthrodires</i>. It is not likely that any group of fishes
has perished through exhaustion of the stock of vigor.</p>

<p><b>Barriers Checking Movement of Marine Fishes.</b>&mdash;The limits
of the distribution of individual species or genera must be
found in some sort of barrier, past or present. The chief barriers
which limit marine fishes are the presence of land, the
presence of great oceans, the differences of temperature arising
from differences in latitude, the nature of the sea bottom, and
the direction of oceanic currents. That which is a barrier to
one species may be an agent in distribution to another. The
common shore fishes would perish in deep waters almost as surely
as on land, while the open Pacific is a broad highway to the
albacore or the swordfish.</p>

<p>Again, that which is a barrier to rapid distribution may become
an agent in the slow extension of the range of a species.
The great continent of Asia is undoubtedly one of the greatest
of barriers to the wide movement of species of fish, yet its long
shore-line enables species to creep, as it were, from bay to bay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
or from rock to rock, till, in many cases, the same species is
found in the Red Sea and in the tide-pools or sand-reaches of
Japan. In the North Pacific, the presence of a range of half-submerged
volcanoes, known as the Aleutian and the Kurile
Islands, has greatly aided the slow movement of the fishes of
the tide-pools and the kelp. To a school of mackerel or of
flying-fishes these rough islands with their narrow channels
might form an insuperable barrier.</p>

Japan. Family <i>Monacanthid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Temperature the Central Fact in Distribution.</b>&mdash;It has long
been recognized that the matter of temperature is the central
fact in all problems of geographical distribution. Few species
in any group freely cross the frost-line, and except as borne by
oceanic currents, not many extend their range far into waters
colder than those in which the species is distinctively at home.
Knowing the average temperature of the water in a given region
we know in general the types of fishes which must inhabit it.
It is the similarity in temperature and physical conditions
which chiefly explains the resemblance of the Japanese fauna
to that of the Mediterranean or the Antilles. This fact alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
must explain the resemblance of the Arctic and Antarctic
faun&aelig;, there being in no case a barrier in the sea that may not
some time be crossed. Like forms lodge in like places.</p>

<p><b>Agency of Ocean Currents.</b>&mdash;We may consider again for a
moment the movements of the great currents in the Pacific as
agencies in the distribution of species.</p>

<p>A great current sets to the eastward, crossing the ocean
just south of the equator. It extends past Samoa and passes
on nearly to the coast of Mexico, touching the Galapagos Islands,
Clipperton Island, and especially the Revillagigedos. This
may account for the number of Polynesian species found on
these islands, about which they are freely mixed with immigrants
from the mainland of Mexico.</p>

<p>From the Revillagigedos<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the current moves northward
and westward, passing the Hawaiian Islands and thence onward
to the Ladrones. The absence in Hawaii of most of the characteristic
fishes of Polynesia and Micronesia may be in part due
to the long detour made by these currents, as the conditions
of life in these groups of islands are not very different. Northeast
of Hawaii is a great spiral current, moving with the hands
of the watch, forming what is called Fleurieu's Whirlpool.
This does not reach the coast of California. This fact may
help to account for the almost complete distinction in the shore
fishes of Hawaii and California.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>No other group of islands in the tropics has a fish fauna
so isolated as that of Hawaii. The genera are largely the
ordinary tropical types. The species are largely peculiar to
these islands.</p>

<p>The westward current from Hawaii reaches Luzon and Formosa.
It is deflected to the northward and, joining a northward
current from Celebes, it forms the Kuro Shiwo or Black
Stream of Japan, which strews its tropical species in the rock
pools along the Japanese promontories as far as Tokio. Then,
turning into the open sea, it passes northward to the Aleutian
Islands, across to Sitka. Thence it moves southward as a cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>current, bearing Ochotsk-Alaskan types southward as far as
the Santa Barbara Islands, to which region it is accompanied
by species of Aleutian origin. A cold return current seems to
extend southward in Japan, along the east shore perhaps as
far as Matsushima. A similar current in the sea to the west of
Japan extends still further to the southward, to Noto, or beyond.</p>

<p>It is, of course, not necessary that the movements of a
species in an oceanic current should coincide with the direction
of the current. Young fishes, or fresh-water fishes, would be
borne along with the water. Those that dwell within floating
bodies of seaweed would go whither the waters carry the drifting
mass. But free-swimming fishes, as the mackerel or flying-fishes,
might as readily choose the reverse direction. To a free-swimming
fish the temperature of the water would be the only
consideration. It is thus evident that a current which to certain
forms would prove a barrier to distribution, to others would be
a mere convenience in movement.</p>

<p>In comparing the Japanese fauna with that of Australia, we
find some trace of both these conditions. Certain forms are
perhaps excluded by cross-currents, while certain others seem
to have been influenced only by the warmth of the water. A
few Australian types on the coast of Chile seem to have been
carried over by the cross-currents of the South Atlantic.</p>

<p>It is fair to say that the part taken by oceanic currents in
the distribution of shore fishes is far from completely demonstrated.
The evidence that they assist in such distribution
is, in brief, as follows:</p>

<p>1. The young of shore fishes often swim at the surface.</p>

<p>2. The young of very many tropical fishes drift northward
in the Gulf Stream and the Japanese Kuro Shiwo.</p>

<p>3. The faunal isolation of Hawaii may be correlated with
the direction of the oceanic currents.</p>

<p><b>Centers of Distribution.</b>&mdash;We may assume, in regard to any
species, that it has had its origin in or near that region in which
it is most abundant and characteristic. Such an assumption
must involve a very large percentage of error or of doubt, but
in considering the mass of species, it may represent essential
truth. In the same fashion we may regard a genus as being
autochthonous or first developed in the region where it shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the greatest range or variety of species. Those regions where
the greatest number of genera are thus autochthonous may be
regarded as centers of distribution. So far as the marine fishes
are concerned, the most important of these supposed centers are
found in the Pacific Ocean. First of these in importance is the
East-Indian Archipelago, with the neighboring shores of India.
Next would come the Arctic Pacific and its bounding islands,
from Japan to British Columbia. Third in importance in this
regard is Australia. Important centers are found in temperate
Japan, in California, the Panama region, and in New Zealand,
Chili, and Patagonia. The fauna of Polynesia is almost entirely
derived from the Indies; and the shore fauna of the Red Sea,
the Bay of Bengal, and Madagascar, so far as genera are concerned,
seems to be not really separable from the Indian fauna
generally.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_244.jpg" width="700" height="352" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 174.</span>&mdash;Globefish, <i>Tetraodon setosus</i> Rosa Smith. Clarion Island, Mexico.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I know of but six genera which may be regarded as autochthonous
in the Red Sea, and nearly all of these are of doubtful
value or of uncertain relation. The many peculiar genera described
by Dr. Alcock, from the dredgings of the <i>Investigator</i>
in the Bay of Bengal, belong to the bathybial or deep-water
series, and will all, doubtless, prove to be forms of wide distribution.</p>

<p>In the Atlantic, the chief center of distribution is the West
Indies; the second is the Mediterranean. On the shores to the
northward or southward of these regions occasional genera have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
found their origin. This is true especially of the New England
region, the North Sea, the Gulf of Guinea, and the coast of
Argentina. The fish fauna of the North Atlantic is derived
mainly from the North Pacific, the differences lying mainly
in the relative paucity of the North Atlantic. But in certain
groups common to the two regions the migration must have
been in the opposite direction, exceptions that prove the rule.</p>

<p><b>Distribution of Marine Fishes.</b>&mdash;The distribution of marine
fishes must be indicated in a different way from that of the
fresh-water forms. The barriers which limit their range furnish
also their means of dispersion. In some cases proximity
overbalances the influence of temperature; with most forms
questions of temperature are all-important.</p>

<p><b>Pelagic Fishes.</b>&mdash;Before consideration of the coast-lines we
may glance at the differences in vertical distribution. Many
species, especially those in groups allied to the mackerel family,
are pelagic&mdash;that is, inhabiting the open sea and ranging
widely within limits of temperature. In this series some species
are practically cosmopolitan. In other cases the genera are
so. Each school or group of individuals has its breeding place,
and from the isolation of breeding districts new species may be
conceived to arise. The pelagic types have reached a species
of equilibrium in distribution. Each type may be found where
suitable conditions exist, and the distribution of species throws
little light on questions of distribution of shore fishes. Yet
among these species are all degrees of localization. The pelagic
fishes shade into the shore fishes on the one hand and into the
deep-sea fishes on the other.</p>

<p><b>Bassalian Fishes.</b>&mdash;The vast group of bassalian or deep-sea
fishes includes those forms which live below the line of adequate
light. These too are localized in their distribution, and
to a much greater extent than was formerly supposed. Yet as
they dwell below the influence of the sun's rays, zones and
surface temperatures are nearly alike to them, and the same
forms may be found in the Arctic or under the equator. Their
differences in distribution are largely vertical, some living at
greater depths than others, and they shade off by degrees from
bathybial into semi-bathybial, and finally into ordinary pelagic
and ordinary shore types. Apparently all of the bassalian fishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
are derived from littoral types, the changes in structure being
due to degeneration of the osseous and muscular systems and
of structures not needed in deep-sea life.</p>

</div>

<p>The fishes of the great depths are soft in substance, some of
them blind, some of them with very large eyes, all black in
color, and very many are provided with luminous spots or areas.
A large body of species of fishes are semi-bathybial, inhabiting
depths of 20 to 100 fathoms, showing many of the characters
of shore fishes, but far more widely distributed. Many of the
remarkable cases of wide distribution of type belong to this
class. In moderate depths red colors are very common, corresponding
to the zone of red alg&aelig;, and the colors in both
cases are perhaps determined from the fact that the red rays
of light are the least refrangible.</p>

<p>A certain number of species are both marine and fresh water,
inhabiting estuaries and brackish waters, while some more
strictly marine ascend the rivers to spawn. In none of these
cases can any hard and fast line be drawn, and some groups
which are shore fishes in one region will be represented by semi-bathybial
or fluviatile forms in another.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Littoral Fishes.</b>&mdash;The shore fishes are in general the most
highly specialized in their respective groups, because exposed
to the greatest variety of selecting conditions and of competition.
Their distribution in space is more definite than that of
the pelagic and bassalian types, and they may be more definitely
assigned to geographical areas.</p>

<p><b>Distribution of Littoral Fishes by Coast-lines.</b>&mdash;Their distribution
is best indicated, not by realms or areas, but as forming
four parallel series corresponding to the four great north
and south continental outlines. Each of these series may be
represented as beginning at the north in the Arctic fauna,
practically identical in each of the four series, actually identical
in the two Pacific series. Passing southward, forms are arranged
according to temperature. One by one in each series, the
Arctic types disappear; subarctic, temperate, and semi-tropical
types take their places, giving way in turn to south-temperate
and Antarctic forms. The distribution of these is modified
by barriers and by currents, yet though genera and species
may be different, each isotherm is represented in each series by
certain general types of fishes.</p>

Family <i>Percid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Passing southward the two American series, the East Atlantic
and the East Pacific, pass on gradually through temperate
to Antarctic types. These are analogous to those of the Arctic,
and in a few cases they are generally identical. The West
Pacific (East Asian) series is not a continuous line on account
of the presence of Australia, the East Indies, and Polynesia.
The irregularities of these regions make a number of subseries,
which break up the simplicity expressed in the idea of four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
parallel series. Yet the fauna of Polynesia is strictly East
Indian, modified by the omission or alteration of species, and
that of Australia is Indian at the north, and changes to the
southward much as that of Africa does. In its marine fishes,
it does not constitute a distinct "realm." The East Atlantic
(Europe-African) series follows the same general lines of change
as that of the West Atlantic. It extends, however, only to the
South Temperate Zone, developing no Antarctic elements. The
relative shortness of Africa explains in large degree, as already
shown, the similarity between the tropical elements in the two
Old-World series, as the similarity in tropical elements in the
two American series must be due to a former depression of the
connecting Isthmus. The practical unity of the Arctic marine
fauna needs no explanation in view of the present shore lines
of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p><b>Minor Faunal Areas.</b>&mdash;The minor faunal areas of shore fishes
may be grouped as follows:</p>

<p><b>Equatorial Fishes Most Specialized.</b>&mdash;In general, the different
types are most highly specialized in equatorial waters.
The processes of specific change, through natural selection or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
other causes, if other causes exist, take place most rapidly there
and produce most far-reaching modification. As elsewhere
stated, the coral reefs of the tropics are the centers of fish-life,
the cities in fish economy. The fresh waters, the arctic waters,
the deep sea and the open sea represent forms of ichthyic backwoods,
regions where change goes on more slowly, and in them
we find survivals of archaic or generalized types. For this reason
the study in detail of the distribution of marine fishes of
equatorial regions is in the highest degree instructive.</p>

<p><b>Realms of Distribution of Fresh-water Fishes.</b>&mdash;If we consider
the fresh-water fishes alone we may divide the land areas of
the earth into districts and zones not differing fundamentally
with those marked out for mammals and birds. The river
basin, bounded by its shores and the sea at its mouth, shows
many resemblances, from the point of view of a fish, to an
island considered as the home of an animal. It is evident that
with fishes the differences in latitude outweigh those of continental
areas, and a primary division into Old World and New
World would not be tenable.</p>

<p>The chief areas of distribution of fresh-water fishes we may
indicate as follows, following essentially the grouping proposed
by Dr. G&uuml;nther:<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><b>Northern Zone.</b>&mdash;With Dr. G&uuml;nther we may recognize first
the <i>Northern Zone</i>, characterized familiarly by the presence of
sturgeon, salmon, trout, whitefish, pike, lamprey, stickleback,
and other species of which the genera and often the species are
identical in Europe, Siberia, Canada, Alaska, and most of the
United States, Japan, and China. This is subject to cross-division
into two great districts, the first Europe-Asiatic, the
second North American. These two agree very closely to the
northward, but diverge widely to the southward, developing a
variety of specialized genera and species, and both of them passing
finally by degrees into the Equatorial Zone.</p>

<p>Still another line of division is made by the Ural Mountains
in the Old World and by the Rocky Mountains in the New. In
both cases the Eastern region is vastly richer in genera and
species, as well as in autochthonous forms, than the Western.
The reason for this lies in the vastly greater extent of the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>basins of China and the Eastern United States, as compared with
those of Europe or the Californian region.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>Minor divisions are those which separate the Great Lake
region from the streams tributary to the Gulf of Mexico; and
in Asia, those which separate China from tributaries of the
Caspian, the Black, and the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><b>Equatorial Zone.</b>&mdash;The Equatorial Zone is roughly indicated
by the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Its essential feature
is that of the temperature, and the peculiarities of its divisions
are caused by barriers of sea or mountains.</p>

<p>Dr. G&uuml;nther finds the best line of separation into two
divisions to lie in the presence or absence of the great group
of dace or minnows,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> to which nearly half of the species of fresh-water
fishes the world over belong. The entire group, now
spread everywhere except in the Arctic, South America, Australia,
and the islands of the Pacific, seems to have had its
origin in India, from which region its genera have radiated in
every direction.</p>

<p>The Cyprinoid division of the Equatorial Zone forms two
districts, the Indian and the African. The Acyprinoid division
includes South America, south of Mexico, and all the islands of
the tropical Pacific lying to the east of Wallace's line. This
line, separating Borneo from Celebes and Bali from Lompoe,
marks in the Pacific the western limit of Cyprinoid fishes, as
well as that of monkeys and other important groups of land
animals. This line, recognized as very important in the distribution
of land animals, coincides in general with the ocean current
between Celebes and Papua, which is one of the sources of the
Kuro Shiwo.</p>

<p>In Australia, Hawaii, and Polynesia generally, the fresh-water
fishes are derived from marine types by modification of
one sort or another. In no case, so far as I know, in any island
to the eastward of Borneo, is found any species derived from
fresh-water families of either the Eastern or the Western Continent.
Of course, minor subdivisions in these districts are formed
by the contour lines of river basins. The fishes of the Nile differ
from those of the Niger or the Congo, or of the streams of Madagascar<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">or Cape Colony, but in all these regions the essential</span><br />
character of the fish fauna remains the same.</p>

<p><b>Southern Zone.</b>&mdash;The third great region, the Southern Zone,
is scantily supplied with fresh-water fishes, and the few it possesses
are chiefly derived from modifications of the marine
fauna or from the Equatorial Zone to the north. Three districts
are recognized&mdash;Tasmania, New Zealand, and Patagonia.</p>

<p><b>Origin of the New Zealand Fauna.</b>&mdash;The fact that certain peculiar
groups are common to these three regions has attracted the
notice of naturalists. In a critical study of the fish fauna of
New Zealand,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Dr. Gill discusses the origin of the four genera
and seven species of fresh-water fishes found in these islands,
the principal of these genera (<i>Galaxias</i>) being represented by
nearly related species in South Australia, in Patagonia,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the
Falkland Islands, and in South Africa.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Gill, we can account for this anomaly of
distribution only by supposing, on the one hand, that their
ancestors were carried for long distances in some unnatural
manner, as (<i>a</i>) having been carried across entombed in ice, or
(<i>b</i>) being swept by ocean currents, surviving their long stay
in salt water, or else that they were derived (<i>c</i>) from some
widely distributed marine type now extinct, its descendants
restricted to fresh water.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Dr. Gill suggests that as "community of
type must be the expression of community of origin," the presence
of fishes of long-established fresh-water types must imply
continuity or at least contiguity of land. The objections raised
by geologists to the supposed land connection of New Zealand
and Tasmania do not appear to Dr. Gill insuperable. It is well
known, he says, "that the highest mountain chains are of comparatively
recent geological age. It remains, then, to consider
which is the more probable, (1) that the types now common in
distant regions were distributed in some unnatural manner by
the means referred to, or (2) that they are descendants of
forms once wide-ranging over lands now submerged." After
considering questions as to change of type in other groups, Dr.
Gill is inclined to postulate, from the occurrence of species of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>trout-like genus <i>Galaxias</i>, in New Zealand, South Australia,
and South America, that "there existed some terrestrial passage-way
between the several regions at a time as late as the
close of the Mesozoic period. The evidence of such a connection
afforded by congeneric fishes is fortified by analogous representatives
among insects, mollusca, and even amphibians.
The separation of the several areas must have occurred little
later than the late Tertiary, inasmuch as the salt-water fishes
of corresponding isotherms found along the coast of the now
widely separated lands are to such a large extent specifically
different. In general, change seems to have taken place more
rapidly among marine animals than fresh-water representatives
of the same class."</p>

<p>In this case, when one guess is set against another, it seems
to me that the hypothesis first suggested, rather than the other,
lies in the line of least logical resistance. I think it better to
adopt provisionally some theory not involving the existence of
a South Pacific Antarctic Continent, to account for the distribution
of <i>Galaxias</i>. For this view I may give five reasons:</p>

<p>1. There are many other cases of the sort equally remarkable
and equally hard to explain. Among these is the presence
of species of paddle-fish and shovel-nosed sturgeon,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> types characteristic
of the Mississippi Valley, in Central Asia. The presence
of one and only one of the five or six American species of
pike<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> in Europe; of one of the three species of mud-minnow
in Austria,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the others being American. Still another curious
case of distribution is that of the large pike-like trout of the genus
<i>Hucho</i>, one species (<i>Hucho hucho</i>) inhabiting the Danube, the
other (<i>Hucho blackistoni</i>) the rivers of northern Japan. Many
such cases occur in different parts of the globe and at present
admit of no plausible explanation.</p>

<p>2. The supposed continental extension should show permanent
traces in greater similarity in the present fauna, both
of rivers and of sea. The other fresh-water genera of the regions
in question are different, and the marine fishes are more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>different than they could be if we imagine an ancient shore
connection. If New Zealand and Patagonia were once united
other genera than <i>Galaxias</i> would be left to show it.</p>

<p>3. We know nothing of the power of <i>Galaxias</i> to survive
submergence in salt water, if carried in a marine current. As
already noticed, I found young and old in abundance of the
commonest of Japanese fresh-water fishes in the open sea, at
a distance from any river. Thus far, this species, the hakone<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
dace, has not been recorded outside of Japan, but it might well
be swept to Korea or China. Two fresh-water fishes of Japanese
origin now inhabit the island of Tsushima in the Straits of
Korea.</p>

<p>4. The fresh-water fishes of Polynesia show a remarkably
wide distribution and are doubtless carried alive in currents.
One river-goby<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> ranges from Tahiti to the Riu Kiu Islands.
Another species,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> originally perhaps from Brazil through Mexico,
shows an equally broad distribution.</p>

<p>5. We know that <i>Galaxias</i> with its relatives must have been
derived from a marine type. It has no affinity with any of the
fresh-water families of either continent, unless it be with the
Salmonid&aelig;. The original type of this group was marine, and
most of the larger species still live in the sea, ascending streams
only to spawn.</p>

<p>When the investigations of geologists show reason for
believing in radical changes in the forms of continents, we
may accept their conclusions. That geological evidence exists
which seems to favor the existence of a former continent, Antarctica,
is claimed on high authority. If this becomes well
established we may well explain the distribution of <i>Galaxias</i>
with reference to it. But we cannot, on the other hand, regard
the anomalous distribution of <i>Galaxias</i> alone constituting proof
of shore connection. There can be no doubt that almost every
case of anomalies in the distribution of fishes admits of a possible
explanation through "the slow action of existing causes."</p>

<p>Real causes are always simple when they are once known.
All anomalies in distribution cease to be such when the facts
necessary to understand them are at our disposal.</p>

ISTHMUS BARRIERS SEPARATING FISH FAUNAS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_255.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Isthmus of Suez.</b>&mdash;In the study of the effect of the
Isthmus of Suez on the distribution of fishes we
may first consider the alleged resemblance between
the fauna of the Mediterranean and that of Japan. Dr.
G&uuml;nther claims that the actual identity of genera and species
in these two regions is such as to necessitate the hypothesis
that they have been in recent times joined by a continuous
shore-line. This shore-line, according to Prof. A. Ortmann
and others, was not across the Isthmus of Suez, but farther
to the northward, probably across Siberia.</p>

<p><b>The Fish Fauna of Japan.</b>&mdash;For a better understanding of
the problem we may give a brief analysis of the fish fauna of
Japan.</p>

<p>The group of islands which constitute the empire of Japan
is remarkable for the richness of its animal life. Its variety in
climatic and other conditions, its nearness to the great continent
of Asia and to the chief center of marine life, the East
Indian Islands, its relation to the warm Black Current or Kuro
Shiwo from the south and to the cold currents from the north,
all tend to give variety and richness to the fauna of its seas.
Especially is this true in the group of fishes. In spite of the
political isolation of the Japanese Empire, this fact has been
long recognized and the characteristic types of Japanese fishes
have been well known to naturalists.</p>

<p>At present about 900 species of fishes are known from the four
great islands which constitute Japan proper&mdash;Hondo, Hokkaido,
Kiusiu, and Shikoku. About 200 others are known from the
volcanic islands to the north and south. Of these 1100 species,
about fifty belong to the fresh waters. These are all closely
allied to forms found on the mainland of Asia, from which re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>gion
all of them were probably derived. In general the same
genera appear in China and with a larger range of species.</p>

<p><b>Fresh-water Faunas of Japan.</b>&mdash;Two faunal areas of fresh
waters may be fairly distinguished, although broadly overlapping.
The northern region includes the island of Hokkaido and
the middle and northern part of the great island of Hondo. In
a rough way, its southern boundary may be defined by Fuji
Yama, and the Bay of Matsushima. It is characterized by the
presence of salmon, trout, and sculpins, and northward by sturgeon
and brook lampreys. The southern area loses by degrees
the trout and other northern fishes, while in its clear waters
abound various minnows, gobies, and the famous ayu, or Japanese
dwarf salmon, one of the most delicate of food fishes. Sculpins
and lampreys give place to minnows, loaches, and chubs. Two
genera, a sculpin<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and a perch,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> besides certain minnows and
catfishes, are confined to this region and seem to have originated
in it, but, like the other species, from Chinese stock.</p>

<p><b>Origin of Japanese Fresh-water Fishes.</b>&mdash;The question of the
origin of the Japanese river fauna seems very simple. All the
types are Asiatic. While most of the Japanese species are distinct,
their ancestors must have been estrays from the mainland.
To what extent river fishes may be carried from place
to place by currents of salt water has never been ascertained.
One of the most widely distributed of Japanese river fishes is
the large hakone dace or chub.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This has been repeatedly
taken by us in the sea at a distance from any stream. It would
evidently survive a long journey in salt water. An allied
species<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> is found in the midway island of Tsushima, between
Korea and Japan.</p>

<p><b>Faunal Areas of Marine Fishes in Japan.</b>&mdash;The distribution
of the marine fishes of Japan is mainly controlled by the temperature
of the waters and the motion of the ocean currents.
Five faunal areas may be more or less clearly recognized, and
these may receive names indicating their scope&mdash;Kurile, Hokkaido,
Nippon, Kiusiu, Kuro Shiwo, and Riu Kiu. The first or
Kurile district is frankly subarctic, containing species characteristic
of the Ochotsk Sea on the one hand, and of Alaska on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>the other. The second or Hokkaido<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> district includes this
northern island and that part of the shore of the main island
of Hondo<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> which lies to the north of Matsushima and Noto.
Here the cold northern currents favor the development of a
northern fauna. The herring and the salmon occupy here the
same economic relation as in Norway, Scotland, Newfoundland,
and British Columbia. Sculpins, blennies, rockfish, and flounders
abound of the rocky shores and are seen in all the markets.</p>

<p>South of Matsushima Bay and through the Island Sea as far
as Kobe, the Nippon fauna is distinctly one of the temperate
zone. Most of the types characteristically Japanese belong here,
abounding in the sandy bays and about the rocky islands.</p>

<p>About the islands of Kiusiu and Shikoku, the semi-tropical
elements increase in number and the Kiusiu fauna is less characteristically
Japanese, having much in common with the neighboring
shores of China, while some of the species range northward
from India and Java. But these faunal districts have
no sharp barriers. Northern fishes<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> unquestionably of Alaskan
origin range as far south as Nagasaki, while certain semi-tropical<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
types extend their range northward to Hakodate and Volcano
Bay. The Inland Sea, which in a sense bounds the southern
fauna, serves at the same time as a means of its extension. While
each species has a fairly definite northern or southern limit, the
boundaries of a faunal district as a whole must be stated in the
most general terms.</p>

<p>The well-known boundary called Blackiston's Line, which
passes through the Straits of Tsugaru, between the two great
islands of Hondo and Hokkaido, marks the northern boundary
of monkeys, pheasants, and most tropical and semi-tropical birds
and mammals of Japan. But as to the fishes, either marine or
fresh water, this line has no significance. The northern fresh-water
species probably readily cross it; the southern rarely
reach it.</p>

<p>We may define as a fourth faunal area that of the Kuro</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Shiwo district itself, which is distinctly tropical and contrasts
strongly with that of the inshore bays behind it. This warm
"Black Current," analogous to our Gulf Stream, has its origin
in part from a return current from the east which passes westward
through Hawaii, in part from a current which passes between
Celebes and New Guinea. It moves northward by way
of Luzon and Formosa, touching the east shores of the Japanese
islands Kiusiu and Shikoku, to the main island of Hondo,
flooding the bays of Kagoshima and Kochi, of Waka, Suruga,
and Sagami. The projecting headlands reach out into it and
the fauna of their rock-pools is distinctly tropical as far to the
northward as Tokio.</p>

</div>

<p>These promontories of Hondo, Waka, Ise, Izu, Misaki, and
Awa have essentially the same types of fishes as are found on
the reefs of tropical Polynesia. The warmth of the off-shore
currents gives the fauna of Misaki its astonishing richness, and
the wealth of life is by no means confined to the fishes. Corals,
crustaceans, worms, and mollusks show the same generous profusion
of species.</p>

<p>A fifth faunal area, closely related to that of the Black Current,
is formed by the volcanic and coral reefs of the Riu Kiu
Archipelago. This fauna, so far as known, is essentially East
Indian, the genera and most of the species being entirely identical
with those of the islands about Java and Celebes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Resemblance of the Japanese and Mediterranean Fish Faunas.</b>&mdash;It
has been noted by Dr. G&uuml;nther that the fish fauna of Japan
bears a marked resemblance to that of the Mediterranean.
This likeness is shown in the actual identity of genera and
species, and in their relation to each other. This resemblance
he proposes to explain by the hypothesis that at some recent
period the two regions, Japan and the Mediterranean, have been
united by a continuous shore-line. The far-reaching character
of this hypothesis demands a careful examination of the data
on which it rests.</p>

<p>The resemblance of the two faunal areas, so far as fishes are
concerned, may be stated as follows: There are certain genera<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
of shore fishes, tropical or semi-tropical, common to the Mediterranean
and Japan, and wanting to California, Panama, and
the West Indies, and in most cases to Polynesia also. Besides
these, certain others found in deeper water (100 to 200 fathoms)
are common to the two areas,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and have been rarely taken
elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Significance of Resemblance.</b>&mdash;The significance of these facts
can be shown only by a fuller analysis of the fauna in question,
and those of other tropical and semi-tropical waters. If
the resemblances are merely casual, or if the resemblances
are shown by other regions, the hypothesis of shore continuity
would be unnecessary or untenable. It is tenable if the resemblances
are so great as to be accounted for in no other way.</p>

<p>Of the genera regarded as common, only two<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> or three are
represented in the two regions by identical species, and these
have a very wide distribution in the warm seas. Of the others,
nearly all range to India, to the Cape of Good Hope, to Australia,
or to Brazil. They may have ranged farther in the past; they
may even range farther at present. Not one is confined to the
two districts in question. As equally great resemblances exist
between Japan and Australia or Japan and the West Indies,
the case is not self-evident without fuller comparison. I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>therefore undertake a somewhat fuller analysis of the evidence
bearing on this and similar problems with a view to the conclusions
which may be legitimately drawn from the facts of fish
distribution.</p>

<p><b>Differences between Japanese and Mediterranean Fish Faunas.</b>&mdash;We
may first, after admitting the alleged resemblances and
others, note that differences are equally marked. In each region
are a certain number of genera which we may consider
as autochthonous. These genera are represented by many
species or by many individuals in the region of their supposed
origin, but are more scantily developed elsewhere. Such genera
in Mediterranean waters are <i>Crenilabrus</i>, <i>Labrus</i>, <i>Spicara</i>, <i>Pagellus</i>,
<i>Mullus</i>, <i>Boops</i>, <i>Spondyliosoma</i>, <i>Oblata</i>. None of these occurs in
Japan, nor have they any near relatives there. Japanese autochthonous
types, as <i>Pseudoblennius</i>, <i>Vellitor</i>, <i>Duym&aelig;ria</i>, <i>Anoplus</i>,
<i>Histiopterus</i>, <i>Monocentrus</i>, <i>Oplegnathus</i>, <i>Plecoglossus</i>, range southward
to the Indies or to Australia, but all of them are totally
unknown to the Mediterranean. The multifarious genera of
Gobies of Japan show very little resemblance to the Mediterranean
fishes of this family, while blennies, labroids, scaroids,
and scorp&aelig;noids are equally diverse in their forms and alliances.
To the same extent that likeness in faunas is produced by continuity
of means of dispersion is it true that unlikeness is due
to breaks in continuity. Such a break in continuity of coast-line,
in the present case, is the Isthmus of Suez, and the unlikeness
in the faunas is about what we might conceive that such a
barrier should produce.</p>

<p><b>Sources of Faunal Resemblances.</b>&mdash;There are two main
sources of faunal resemblances: first, the absence of any barriers
permitting the actual mingling of the species; second, the likeness
of temperature and shore configuration on either side of
an imperfect barrier. Absolute barriers do not exist and apparently
never have existed in the sea. If the fish faunas of
different regions have mingled in recent times, the fact would
be shown by the presence of the same species in each region.
If the union were of a remote date, the species would be changed,
but the genera might remain identical.</p>

<p>In case of close physical resemblances in different regions, as
in the East Indies and West Indies, like conditions would favor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the final lodgement of like types, but the resemblance would
be general, the genera and species being unlike. Without doubt
part of the resemblance between Japan and the Mediterranean
is due to similarity of temperature and shores. Is that which
remains sufficient to demand the hypothesis of a former shore-line
connection?</p>

<p><b>Effects of Direction of Shore-line.</b>&mdash;We may first note that a
continuous shore-line produces a mingling of fish faunas only
when not interrupted by barriers due to climate. A north and
south coast-line, like that of the East Pacific, however unbroken,
permits great faunal differences. It is crossed by the different
zones of temperature. An east and west shore-line lies in the
same temperature. In all cases of the kind which now exist
on the earth (the Mediterranean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean
Sea, the shores of India), even species will extend their
range as far as the shore-line goes. The obvious reason is
because such a shore-line rarely offers any important barrier to
distribution, checking dispersion of species. We may, therefore,
consider the age and nature of the Isthmus of Suez and
the character of the faunas it separates.</p>

<p><b>Numbers of Genera in Different Faunas.</b>&mdash;For our purposes
the genera must be rigidly defined, a separate name being used
in case of each definable difference in structure. The wide-ranging
genera of the earlier systematists were practically cosmopolitan,
and their geographical distribution teaches us little.
On the other hand, when we come to the study of geological
distribution, the broad definition of the genus is the only one
usually available. The fossil specimens are always defective.
Minor characters may be lost past even the possibility of a
guess, and only along broad lines can we achieve the classification
of the individual fossil.</p>

<p>Using the modern definition of genus, we find in Japan 483
genera of marine fishes; in the Red Sea, 225; in the Mediterranean,
231. In New Zealand 150 are recorded; in Hawaii,
171; 357 from the West Indies, 187 from the Pacific coast of
tropical America, 300 from India, 450 from the East-Indian
islands, and 227 from Australia.</p>

<p>Of the 483 genera ascribed to Japan, 156 are common to the
Mediterranean also, 188 to the West Indies and Japan, 169 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the Pacific coast of the United States and Mexico. With
Hawaii Japan shares 90 genera, with New Zealand 62; 204 are
common to Japan and India, 148 to Japan and the Red Sea,
most of these being found in India also. Two hundred genera
are common to Japan and Australia.</p>

<p>From this it is evident that Japan and the Mediterranean
have much in common, but apparently not more than Japan
shares with other tropical regions. Japan naturally shows most
likeness to India, and next to this to the Red Sea. Proportionately
less is the resemblance to Australia, and the likeness to the
Mediterranean seems much the same as that to the West Indies
or to the Pacific coast of America.</p>

<p>But, to make these comparisons just and effective, we should
consider not the fish fauna as a whole; we should limit our discussion
solely to the forms of equatorial origin. From the
fauna of Japan we may eliminate all the genera of Alaskan-Aleutian
origin, as these could not be found in the other regions
under comparison. We should eliminate all pelagic and all
deep-sea forms, for the laws which govern the distribution of
these are very different from those controlling the shore fishes,
and most of the genera have reached a kind of equilibrium
over the world.</p>

<p><b>Significance of Rare Forms.</b>&mdash;We may note also, as a source
of confusion in our investigation, that numerous forms found
in Japan and elsewhere are very rarely taken, and their real
distribution is unknown. Some of these will be found to
have, in some unexpected quarter, their real center of dispersion.
In fact, since these pages were written, I have taken in
Hawaii representatives of three<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> genera which I had enumerated
as belonging chiefly to Japan and the West Indies.
Numerous other genera common to the two regions have since
been obtained by Dr. Gilbert. Such species may inhabit
oceanic plateaus, and find many halting places in their circuit
of the tropical oceans. We have already discovered that
Madeira, St. Helena, Ascension, and other volcanic islands constitute
such halting places. We shall find many more such,
when the deeper shore regions are explored, the region between
market-fishing and the deep-sea dredgings of the <i>Challenger</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>the <i>Albatross</i>. In some cases, no doubt, these forms are verging
on extinction and a former wide distribution has given place to
isolated colonies.</p>

<p>The following table shows the contents, so far as genera are
concerned, of those equatorial areas in which trustworthy catalogues
of species are accessible. It includes only those fishes
of stationary habit living in less than 200 fathoms. It goes
without saying that considerable latitude must be given to
these figures, to allow for errors, omissions, uncertainties, and
differences of opinion.</p>

<p><b>Extension of Indian Fauna.</b>&mdash;From the above tables it is evident
that the warm-water fauna of Japan, as well as that of
Hawaii, is derived from the great body of the fauna of the East
Indies and Hindostan; that the fauna of the Red Sea is derived
in the same way; that the fauna of the Mediterranean bears
no especial resemblance to that of Japan, rather than to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
elements of the East Asiatic fauna in similar conditions of temperature,
and no greater than is borne by either to the West
Indies; that the faunas of the sides of the Isthmus of Suez
have relatively little in common, while those of the two sides
of the Isthmus of Panama show large identity of genera, although
few species are common to the two sides. Of the 255
genera recorded from the Panama region, 179, or over 70 per
cent., are also in the West Indies, while 68, or more than 30
per cent. of the number, are limited to the two regions in question.</p>

<p><b>The Isthmus of Suez as a Barrier to Distribution.</b>&mdash;With the
aid of the above table we may examine further the relation
of the fauna of Japan to that of the Mediterranean. If a
continuity of shore-line once existed, it would involve the obliteration
of the Isthmus. With free connection across this
isthmus the fauna of the Red Sea must have been once
practically the same as that of the Mediterranean. The present
differences must be due to later immigrations to one or
the other region, or to the extinction of species in one locality
or the other, through some kind of unfitness. In neither
region is there evidence of extensive immigration from the outside.
The present conditions of water and temperature differ
a little, but not enough to explain the difference in faun&aelig;.
The Red Sea is frankly tropical and its fauna is essentially
Indian, much the same, so far as genera are concerned, as that
of southern Japan. The Mediterranean is at most not more
than semi-tropical and its fishes are characteristically European.
Its tropical forms belong rather to Guinea than to the East
Indies. With the Red Sea the Mediterranean has very little
in common, not so much, for example, as has Hawaii. Forty
genera of shore fishes (and only fifty of all fishes) are identical
in the two regions, the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Of
those, every one is a genus of wide distribution, found in nearly
all warm seas. Of shore fishes, only one genus in seven is common
to the two regions. Apparently, therefore, we cannot
assume a passage across the Isthmus of Suez within the lifetime
of the present genera. Not one of the types alleged to
be peculiar to Japan and the Mediterranean is thus far known
in the Red Sea. Not one of the characteristically abundant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Mediterranean types<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> crosses the Isthmus of Suez, and the distinctive
Red Sea and Indian types<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> are equally wanting in
the Mediterranean. The only genera which could have crossed
the Isthmus are certain shallow-water or brackish-water forms,
sting-rays, torpedoes, sardines, eels, and mullets, widely diffused
through the East Indies and found also in the Mediterranean.
The former channel, if one ever existed, had, therefore,
much the same value in distribution of species as the present
Suez Canal.</p>

<p><b>Geological Evidence of Submergence of the Isthmus of Suez.</b>&mdash;Yet,
from geological data, there is strong evidence that the
Isthmus of Suez was submerged in relatively recent times. The
recognized geological maps of the Isthmus show that a broad
area of post-Pliocene or Pliocene deposits constitutes the Isthmus
and separates the nummulitic hills of Suez from their fellows
about thirty miles to the eastward. The northern part
of the Isthmus is alluvium from the Nile, and its western part
is covered with drifting sands. The Red Sea once extended
farther north than now and the Mediterranean farther to the
southeast. Assuming the maps to be correct, the Isthmus
must have been open water in the late Pliocene or post-Pliocene
times.</p>

<p>Admitting this as a fact, the difference in the fish fauna would
seem to show that the waters over the submerged area were so
shallow that the rock-loving forms did not and could not cross
it. Moreover, the region was very likely overspread with silt-bearing
fresh waters from the Nile. To such fishes as <i>Ch&aelig;todon</i>,
<i>Holocentrus</i>, <i>Thalassoma</i> of the Red Sea, or to <i>Crenilabrus</i>,
<i>Boops</i>, and <i>Zeus</i> of the Mediterranean, such waters would form
a barrier as effective as the sand-dunes of to-day.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions as to the Isthmus of Suez.</b>&mdash;We are led, therefore,
to these conclusions:</p>

<p>1. There is no evidence derivable from the fishes of the
recent submergence of the Isthmus of Suez.</p>

<p>2. If the Isthmus was submerged in Pliocene or post-Pliocene
times, the resultant channel was shallow and muddy, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>that ordinary marine fishes or fishes of rock bottoms or of
deep waters did not cross it.</p>

<p>3. It formed an open water to brackish-water fishes only.</p>

<p>4. The types common to Japan and the Mediterranean did
not enter either region from the other by way of the Red Sea.</p>

<p>5. As most of these are found also in India or Australia or
both, their dispersion was probably around the south coast of
Africa or by the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>6. In view of the fact that numerous East Indian genera, as
<i>Zanclus</i>, <i>Enoplosus</i>, <i>Toxotes</i>, <i>Ephippus</i>, <i>Platax</i>, <i>Teuthis</i>, <i>Acanthurus</i>
(<i>Monoceros</i>), <i>Myripristis</i> occur in the Eocene rocks of
Tuscany, Syria, and Switzerland, we may well suppose that an open
waterway across Africa then existed. Perhaps these forms were
destroyed in European waters by a wave of glacial cold, perhaps
after the Miocene. As our knowledge of the Miocene fish
faun&aelig; of Europe is still imperfect, we cannot locate accurately
the period of their disappearance. About half the species found
in the Eocene of Italy belong to existing genera, and these
genera are almost all now represented in the Indian fauna, and
those named above with others are confined to it.</p>

<p>The study of fishes alone furnishes no adequate basis for
mapping the continental masses of Tertiary times. The known
facts in regard to their distribution agree fairly with the provisional
maps lately published by Dr. Ortmann (Bull. Philos.
Soc., XLI). In the Eocene map (Fig. 179) the Mediterranean
extends to the northward of Arabia, across to the mouth of
the Ganges. This extension would account for the tropical,
Eocene, and Miocene fish fauna of Southern Europe.</p>

<p><b>The Cape of Good Hope as a Barrier to Fishes.</b>&mdash;The fishes
of the Cape of Good Hope are not well enough known for close
comparison with those of other regions. Enough is known of
the Cape fauna to show its general relation to those of India
and Australia. The Cape of Good Hope lies in the South Temperate
Zone. It offers no absolutely impassable barrier to the
tropical fishes from either side. It bears a closer relation to
either the Red Sea or the Mediterranean than they bear to
each other. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that the
transfer of tropical shore fishes of the Old World between the
Atlantic and Pacific, in recent times, has taken place mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
around the southern point of Africa. To pelagic and deep-sea
fishes the Cape of Good Hope has offered no barrier whatever.
To ordinary fishes it is an obstacle, but not an impassable one.
This the fauna itself shows. It has, however, not been passed
by many tropical species, and by these only as the result of
thousands of years of struggle and point-to-point migration.</p>

<p><b>Relations of Japan to Mediterranean Explainable by Present
Conditions.</b>&mdash;We may conclude that the resemblance of the
Mediterranean fish fauna to that of Japan or India is no more
than might be expected, even had the present contour of the
continents been permanent for the period of duration of the
present genera and species. An open channel in recent times
would have produced much greater resemblances than actually
exist.</p>

<p><b>The Isthmus of Panama as a Barrier to Distribution.</b>&mdash;Conditions
in some regards parallel with those of the Isthmus of
Suez exist in but one other region&mdash;the Isthmus of Panama.
Here the first observers were very strongly impressed by
the resemblance of forms. Nearly half the genera found on
the two sides of this isthmus are common to both sides. Taking
those of the Pacific shore for first consideration, we find that
three-fourths of the genera of the Panama fauna occur in the
West Indies as well.</p>

<p>This identity is many times greater than that existing at
the Isthmus of Suez. Moreover, while the Cape of Good Hope
offers no impassable barrier to distribution, the same is not
true of the southern part of South America. The subarctic
climate of Cape Horn has doubtless formed a complete check
to the movements of tropical fishes for a vast period of geologic
time.</p>

<p><b>Unlikeness of Species on the Shores of the Isthmus of Panama.</b>&mdash;But,
curiously enough, this marked resemblance is confined
chiefly to the genera and does not extend to the species on the
two shores.</p>

<p>Of 1400 species of fishes recorded from tropical America
north of the Equator, only about 70 are common to the two
coasts. The number of shore fishes common is still less. In
this 70 are included a certain number of cosmopolitan types
which might have reached either shore from the Old World.</p>

<p>A few others invade brackish or fresh waters and may possibly
have found their way, in one way or another, across the
Isthmus of Nicaragua. Of fishes strictly marine, strictly littoral,
and not known from Asia or Polynesia, scarcely any
species are left as common to the two sides. This seems to
show that no waterway has existed across the Isthmus within
the lifetime, whatever that may be, of the existing species.
The close resemblance of genera shows apparently with almost
equal certainty that such a waterway has existed, and within
the period of existence of the groups called genera. How long
a species of fish may endure unchanged no one knows, but we
know that in this regard great differences must exist in different
groups. Assuming that different species crossed the
Isthmus of Panama in Miocene times, we should not be surprised
to find that a few remain to all appearances unchanged;
that a much larger number have become "representative"
species, closely related forms retaining relations to the environment
to those of the parent form, and, finally, that a few
species have been radically altered.</p>

<p>This is exactly what has taken place at the Isthmus of
Panama with the marine shore fishes. Curiously enough, the
movement of genera seems to have been chiefly from the Atlantic
to the Pacific. Certain characteristic genera<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> of the
Panama region have not passed over to the Pacific. On the
other hand, most of the common genera<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> show a much larger
number of species on the Atlantic side. This may be held to
show their Atlantic origin.</p>

<p>Of the relatively small number of genera which Panama has
received from Polynesia<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> few have crossed the Isthmus to appear
in the West Indian fauna.</p>

<p><b>Views of Earlier Writers on the Fishes of the Isthmus of Panama.</b>&mdash;The
elements of the problem at Panama may be better understood
by a glance at the results of previous investigations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1869 Dr. G&uuml;nther, after enumerating the species examined
by him from Panama, reaches the conclusion that nearly
one-third of the marine fishes on the two shores of tropical
America will be found to be identical. He enumerates 193 such
species as found on the two coasts; 59 of these, or 31 per cent.
of the total, being actually identical. From this he infers that
there must have been, at a comparatively recent date, a depression
of the Isthmus and intermingling of the two faunas.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><b>Catalogue of Fishes of Panama.</b>&mdash;In an enumeration of the
fishes of the Pacific coast in 1885,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> the present writer showed
that Dr. G&uuml;nther's conclusions were based on inadequate data.</p>

<p>In my list 407 species were recorded from the Pacific coast
of tropical America&mdash;twice the number enumerated by Dr.
G&uuml;nther. Of these 71 species, or 17&frac12; per cent., were found
also in the Atlantic. About 800 species are known from the
Caribbean and adjacent shores, so that out of the total number
of 1,136 species but 71, or 6 per cent. of the whole, are common
to the two coasts. This number does not greatly exceed that of
the species common to the West Indies and the Mediterranean,
or even the West Indies and Japan. It is to be noted also
that the number 71 is not very definitely ascertained, as there
must be considerable difference of opinion as to the boundaries
of species, and the actual identity in several cases is open to
doubt.</p>

<p>This discrepancy arises from the comparatively limited representation
of the two faunas at the disposal of Dr. G&uuml;nther.
He enumerates 193 marine or brackish-water species as found
on the two coasts, 59 of which are regarded by him as specifically
identical, this being 31 per cent. of the whole. But in
30 of these 59 cases I regard the assumption of complete identity
as erroneous, so that taking the number 193 as given I would
reduce the percentage to 15. But these 193 species form but
a fragment of the total fauna, and any conclusion based on
such narrow data is certain to be misleading.</p>

<p>Of the 71 identical species admitted in our list, several (<i>e.g.</i>,
<i>Mola</i>, <i>Thunnus</i>) are pelagic fishes common to most warm seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Still others (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Trachurus</i>, <i>Carangus</i>, <i>Diodon</i> sp.) are cosmopolitan
in the tropical waters. Most of the others (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Gobius</i>,
<i>Gerres</i>, <i>Centropomus</i>, <i>Galeichthys</i> sp., etc.) often ascend the rivers
of the tropics, and we may account for their diffusion, perhaps,
as we account for the dispersion of fresh-water fishes on the
Isthmus, on the supposition that they may have crossed from
marsh to marsh at some time in the rainy season.</p>

<p>In very few cases are representatives of any species from
opposite sides of the Isthmus exactly alike in all respects. These
differences in some cases seem worthy of specific value, giving us
"representative species" on the two sides. In other cases the
distinctions are very trivial, but in most cases they are appreciable,
especially in fresh specimens.</p>

<p>Further, I expressed the belief that "fuller investigation
will not increase the proportion of common species. If it does
not, the two faunas show no greater resemblance than the similarity
of physical conditions on the two sides would lead us to
expect." This similarity causes the same types of fishes to
persist on either side of the Isthmus while through isolation or
otherwise these have become different as species.</p>

<p>This conclusion must hold so far as species are concerned,
but the resemblance of the genera on the sides has a significance
of its own.</p>

<p>In 1880<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Dr G&uuml;nther expressed his views in still stronger
language, claiming a still larger proportion of the fishes of tropical
America to be identical on the two sides of the continent.
He concluded that "with scarcely any exceptions the genera are
identical, and of the species found on the Pacific side, nearly
one-half have proved to be the same as those of the Atlantic.
The explanation of this fact has been found in the existence of
communications between the two oceans by channels and straits
which must have been open till within a recent period. The
isthmus of Central America was then partially submerged, and
appeared as a chain of islands similar to that of the Antilles;
but as the reef-building corals flourished chiefly north and east
of these islands and were absent south and west of them, reef
fishes were excluded from the Pacific shores when the communications
were destroyed by the upheaval of land."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Conclusions of Evermann and Jenkins.</b>&mdash;This remark led to
a further discussion of the subject on the part of Dr. B. W.
Evermann and Dr. O. P. Jenkins. From their paper on the
fishes of Guaymas<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> I make the following quotations:</p>

<p>"The explorations since 1885 have resulted (1) in an addition
of about 100 species to one or other of the two faunas;
(2) in showing that at least two species that were regarded as
identical on the two shores<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> are probably distinct; and (3) in
the addition of but two species to those common to both coasts.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>"All this reduces still further the percentage of common
species.</p>

<p>"Of the 110 species obtained by us, 24, or less than 21
per cent., appear to be common to both coasts. Of these 24
species, at least 16, from their wide distribution, would need
no hypothesis of a former waterway through the Isthmus to
account for their presence on both sides. They are species
fully able to arrive at the Pacific shores of the Americas
from the warm seas west. It thus appears that not more than
eight species, less than 8 per cent. of our collection, all of which
are marine species, require any such hypothesis to account for
their occurrence on both coasts of America. This gives us,
then, 1,307 species that should properly be taken into account
when considering this question, not more than 72 of which, or
5.5 per cent., seem to be identical on the two coasts. This is
very different from the figures given by Dr. G&uuml;nther in his
'Study of Fishes.'</p>

<p>"Now, if from these 72 species, admitted to be common to
both coasts, we subtract the 16 species of wide distribution&mdash;so
wide as to keep them from being a factor in this problem&mdash;we
have left but 56 species common to the two coasts that bear
very closely upon the waterway hypothesis. <i>This is less than
4.3 per cent. of the whole number.</i></p>

<p>"But the evidence obtained from a study of other marine
life of that region points to the same conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"In 1881, Dr. Paul Fischer discussed the same question in
his 'Manual de Conchyliologie,' pp. 168, 169, in a section on
the Molluscan Fauna of the Panamic Province, and reached
the same general conclusions. He says: 'Les naturalistes
Am&eacute;ricians se sont beaucoup pre&eacute;occup&eacute;s des esp&egrave;ces de Panama
qui paraissent identiques avec celles des Antilles, ou qui sont
repr&eacute;sentatives. P. Carpenter estime qu'il en existe 35. Dans
la plupart des cas, l'identite absolue n'a pu &ecirc;tre constant&eacute;e
et on a trouv&eacute; quelques caract&egrave;res distinctifs, ce qui n'a rien
d'&egrave;tonnant, puisque dans l'hypoth&egrave;se d'une origine commune,
les deux races pacifique et atlantique sont s&eacute;par&eacute;e depuis la
periode Mioc&egrave;ne. Voici un liste de ces esp&egrave;ces repr&eacute;sentatives
ou identiques.' Here follows a list of 20 species. 'Mais ces
formes semblables,' he says, 'constituent un infime minorit&eacute;
(3 per cent.).'</p>

<p>"These facts have a very important bearing upon certain
geological questions, particularly upon the one concerning the
cold of the Glacial period.</p>

<p>"In Dr. G. Frederick Wright's recent book, 'The Ice Age in
North America,' eight different theories as to the cause of the
cold are discussed. The particular theory which seems to him
quite reasonable is that one which attributes the cold as due
to a change of different parts of the country, and a depression
of the Isthmus of Panama is one of the important changes he
considers. He says: 'Should a portion of the Gulf Stream be
driven through a depression across the Isthmus of Panama into
the Pacific, and an equal portion be diverted from the Atlantic
coast of the United States by an elevation of the sea-bottom
between Florida and Cuba, the consequences would necessarily
be incalculably great, so that the mere existence of such a possible
cause for great changes in the distribution of moisture
over the northern hemisphere is sufficient to make one hesitate
before committing himself unreservedly to any other theory;
at any rate, to one which has not for itself independent and
adequate proof.'</p>

<p>"In the appendix to the same volume Mr. Warren Upham,
in discussing the probable causes of glaciation, says: 'The quaternary
uplifts of the Andes and Rocky Mountains and of the
West Indies make it nearly certain that the Isthmus of Panama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
has been similarly elevated during the recent epoch.... It
may be true, therefore, that the submergence of this isthmus
was one of the causes of the Glacial period, the continuation of
the equatorial oceanic currents westward into the Pacific having
greatly diminished or wholly diverted the Gulf Stream, which
carries warmth from the tropics to the northern Atlantic and
northwestern Europe.'</p>

<p>"Any <i>very</i> recent means by which the fishes could have
passed readily from one side to the other would have resulted in
making the fish faunas of the two shores practically identical;
but the time that has elapsed since such a waterway could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
existed has been long enough to allow the fishes of the two sides
to become <i>practically distinct</i>. That the mollusks of the two
shores are almost wholly distinct, as shown by Dr. Fischer, is
even stronger evidence of the remoteness of the time when the
means of communication between the two oceans could have
existed, for 'species' among the mollusks are probably more
persistent than among fishes.</p>

<p>"Our present knowledge, therefore, of the fishes of tropical
America justifies us in regarding the fish faunas of the two coasts
as being essentially distinct, and believing that there has not
been, at any comparatively recent time, any waterway through
the Isthmus of Panama."</p>

<p>It is thus shown, I think, conclusively, that the Isthmus of
Panama could not have been depressed for any great length
of time in a recent geological period.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions of Dr. Hill.</b>&mdash;These writers have not, however, considered
the question of generic identity. To this we may find
a clue in the geological investigations of Dr. Robert T. Hill.</p>

<p>In a study of "The Geological History of the Isthmus of
Panama and Portions of Costa Rica," Dr. Hill uses the following
language:</p>

<p>"By elimination we have concluded that the only period
of time since the Mesozoic within which communication between
the seas could have taken place is the Tertiary period,
and this must be restricted to the Eocene and Oligocene epochs
of that period. The paleontologic evidence upon which such
an opening can be surmised at this period is the occurrence of a
few California Eocene types in the Atlantic sides of the tropical
American barrier, within the ranges of latitude between Galveston
(Texas) and Colon, which are similar to others found in
California. There are no known structural data upon which
to locate the site of this passage, but we must bear in mind,
however, that this structure has not been completely explored.</p>

<p>"Even though it was granted that the coincidence of the occurrence
of a few identical forms on both sides of the tropical
American region, out of the thousands which are not common,
indicates a connection between the two seas, there is still an
absence of any reason for placing this connection at the Isthmus
of Panama, and we could just as well maintain that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
locus thereof might have been at some other point in the Central
American region.</p>

<p>"The reported fossil and living species common to both
oceans are littoral forms, which indicate that if a passage existed
it must have been of a shallow and ephemeral character.</p>

<p>"There is no evidence from either a geologic or a biologic
standpoint for believing that the oceans have ever communicated
across the Isthmian regions since Tertiary time. In
other words, there is no evidence for these later passages which
have been established upon hypothetical data, especially those
of Pleistocene time.</p>

<p>"The numerous assertions, so frequently found in literature,
that the two oceans have been frequently and recently
connected across the Isthmus, and that the low passes indicative
of this connection still exist, may be dismissed at once
and forever and relegated to the domain of the apocryphal. A
few species common to the waters of both oceans in a predominantly
Caribbean fauna of the age of the Claiborne epoch of
the Eocene Tertiary is the only paleontologic evidence in any
time upon which such a connection may be hypothesized.</p>

<p>"There has been a tendency in literature to underestimate
the true altitude of the isthmian passes, which, while probably
not intentional, has given encouragement to those who think
that this Pleistocene passage may have existed. Maack has
erroneously given the pass at 186 feet. Dr. J. W. Gregory
states 'that the summit of the Isthmus at one locality is 154
feet and in another 287 feet in height.' The lowest isthmian
pass, which is not a summit, but a drainage col, is 287-295
feet above the ocean.</p>

<p>"If we could lower the isthmian region 300 feet at present,
the waters of the two oceans would certainly commingle through
the narrow Culebra Pass. But the Culebra Pass is clearly
the headwater col of two streams, the Obispo flowing into the
Chagres, and the Rio Grande flowing into the Pacific, and has
been cut by fluviatile action, and not by marine erosion, out
of a land mass which has existed since Miocene time. Those
who attempt to establish Pleistocene interoceanic channels
through this pass on account of its present low altitude must
not omit from their calculations the restoration of former rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
masses which have been removed by the general levelling of
the surface by erosion."</p>

Family <i>Lutianid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In conclusion, Dr. Hill asserts that "there is considerable
evidence that a land barrier in the tropical region separated
the two oceans as far back in geologic history as Jurassic time,
and that that barrier continued throughout the Cretaceous
period. The geological structure of the Isthmus and Central
American regions, so far as investigated, when considered aside
from the paleontology, presents no evidence by which the
former existence of a free communication of oceanic waters
across the present tropical land barriers can be established. The
paleontologic evidence indicates the ephemeral existence of a
passage at the close of the Eocene period. All lines of inquiry&mdash;geologic,
paleontologic, and biologic&mdash;give evidence that no
connection has existed between the two oceans since the close
of the Oligocene. This structural geology is decidedly opposed
to any hypothesis by which the waters of the two oceans could
have been connected across the regions in Miocene, Pliocene,
Pleistocene, or recent times."</p>

<p><b>Final Hypothesis as to Panama.</b>&mdash;If we assume the correctness
of Dr. Hill's conclusions, they may accord in a remarkable
degree with the actual facts of the distribution of the fishes
about the Isthmus. To account for the remarkable identity
of genera and divergence of species I may suggest the following
hypothesis:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>During the lifetime of most of the present species, the Isthmus
has not been depressed. It was depressed in or before
Miocene time, during the lifetime of most of the present genera.
We learn from other sources that few of the extant species of
fishes are older than the Pliocene. Relatively few genera go
back to the Eocene, and most of the modern families appear
to begin in the Eocene or later Cretaceous. In general the
Miocene may be taken as the date of the origin of modern
genera. The channel formed across the Isthmus was relatively
shallow, excluding forms inhabiting rocky bottoms at considerable
depths. It was wide enough to permit the infiltration from
the Caribbean Sea of numerous species, especially of shore
fishes of sandy bays, tide pools, and brackish estuaries. The
currents set chiefly to the westward, favoring the transfer of
Atlantic rather than Pacific types.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

Family <i>Silurid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Since the date of the closing of this channel the species left
on the two sides have been altered in varying degrees by the
processes of natural selection and isolation. The cases of actual
specific identity are few, and the date of the establishment as
species, of the existing forms, is subsequent to the date of the
last depression of the Isthmus.</p>

<p>We may be certain that none of the common genera ever
found their way around Cape Horn. Most of them disappear
to the southward, along the coasts of Brazil and Peru.</p>

<p>While local oscillations, involving changes in coast-lines,
have doubtless frequently taken place and are still going on,
the past and present distribution of fishes does not alone give
adequate data for their investigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, it goes without saying that we have no knowledge
of the period of time necessary to work specific changes in a
body of species isolated in an alien sea. Nor have we any
data as to the effect on a given fish fauna of the infiltration
of many species and genera belonging to another. All such
forces and results must be matters of inference.</p>

<p>The present writer does not wish to deny that great changes
have taken place in the outlines of continents in relatively
recent times. He would, however, insist that the theory of
such changes must be confirmed by geological evidence, and
evidence from groups other than fishes, and that likeness in
separated fish faunas may not be conclusive.</p>

DISPERSION OF FRESH-WATER FISHES<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_282.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Dispersion</span> of Fishes.</b>&mdash;The methods of dispersion of
fishes may be considered apart from the broader topic
of distribution or the final results of such dispersion.
In this discussion we are mainly concerned with the fresh-water
fishes, as the methods of distribution of marine fishes through
marine currents and by continuity of shore and water ways
are all relatively simple.</p>

<p><b>The Problem of Oatka Creek.</b>&mdash;When I was a boy and went
fishing in the brooks of western New York, I noticed that
the different streams did not always have the same kinds of
fishes in them. Two streams in particular in Wyoming County,
not far from my father's farm, engaged in this respect my special
attention. Their sources are not far apart, and they flow in
opposite directions, on opposite sides of a low ridge&mdash;an old
glacial moraine, something more than a mile across. The Oatka
Creek flows northward from this ridge, while the East Coy runs
toward the southeast on the other side of it, both flowing ultimately
into the same river, the Genesee.</p>

<p>It does not require a very careful observer to see that in
these two streams the fishes are not quite the same. The
streams themselves are similar enough. In each the waters are
clear and fed by springs. Each flows over gravel and clay,
through alluvial meadows, in many windings, and with elms
and alders "in all its elbows." In both streams we were sure
of finding trout,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and in one of them the trout are still abundant.
In both we used to catch the brook chub,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> or, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>called it, the "horned dace"; and in both were large schools
of shiners<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and of suckers.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> But in every deep hole, and especially
in the millponds along the East Coy Creek, the horned
pout<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> swarmed on the mucky bottoms. In every eddy, or in
the deep hole worn out at the root of the elm-trees, could be
seen the sunfish,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> strutting in green and scarlet, with spread
fins keeping intruders away from its nest. But in the Oatka
Creek were found neither horned pout nor sunfish, nor have
I ever heard that either has been taken there. Then besides
these nobler fishes, worthy of a place on every schoolboy's string,
we knew by sight, if not by name, numerous smaller fishes,
darters<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and minnows,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> which crept about in the gravel on
the bottom of the East Coy, but which we never recognized in
the Oatka.</p>

<p>There must be a reason for differences like these, in the
streams themselves or in the nature of the fishes. The sunfish
and the horned pout are home-loving fishes to a greater
extent than the others which I have mentioned; still, where
no obstacles prevent, they are sure to move about. There
must be, then, in the Oatka some sort of barrier, or strainer,
which keeping these species back permits others more adventurous
to pass; and a wider knowledge of the geography of
the region showed that such is the case. Farther down in its
course, the Oatka falls over a ledge of rock, forming a considerable
waterfall at Rock Glen. Still lower down its waters disappear
in the ground, sinking into some limestone cavern or
gravel-bed, from which they reappear, after some six miles, in
the large springs at Caledonia. Either of these barriers might
well discourage a quiet-loving fish; while the trout and its
active associates have some time passed them, else we should
not find them in the upper waters in which they alone form
the fish fauna. This problem is a simple one; a boy could
work it out, and the obvious solution seems to be satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Generalizations as to Dispersion.</b>&mdash;Since those days I have
been a fisherman in many waters,&mdash;not an angler exactly, but
one who fishes for fish, and to whose net nothing large or small
ever comes amiss; and wherever I go I find cases like this.</p>

<p>We do not know all the fishes of America yet, nor all those
well that we know by sight; still this knowledge will come with
time and patience, and to procure it is a comparatively easy
task. It is also easy to ascertain the more common inhabitants
of any given stream. It is difficult, however, to obtain negative
results which are really results. You cannot often say
that a species does not live in a certain stream. You can
only affirm that you have not yet found it there, and you can
rarely fish in any stream so long that you can find nothing
that you have not taken before. Still more difficult is it to
gather the results of scattered observations into general statements
regarding the distribution of fishes. The facts may be
so few as to be misleading, or so numerous as to be confusing,
and the few writers who have taken up this subject in detail
have found both these difficulties to be serious. Whatever
general propositions we may maintain must be stated with the
modifying clause of "other things being equal"; and other things
are never quite equal. The saying that "Nature abhors a
generalization" is especially applicable to all discussions of the
relations of species to environment.</p>

<p>Still less satisfactory is our attempt to investigate the causes
on which our partial generalizations depend,&mdash;to attempt to
break to pieces the "other things being equal" which baffle us
in our search for general laws. The same problems, of course,
come up on each of the other continents and in all groups of
animals or plants; but most that I shall say will be confined
to the question of the dispersion of fishes in the fresh waters of
North America. The broader questions of the boundaries of
faun&aelig; and of faunal areas I shall bring up only incidentally.</p>

<p><b>Questions Raised by Agassiz.</b>&mdash;Some of the problems to be
solved were first noticed by Prof. Agassiz in 1850, in his work
on Lake Superior. Later (1854), in a paper on the fishes of
the Tennessee River,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> he makes the following statement:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>
<p>"The study of these features [of distribution] is of the greatest
importance, inasmuch as it may eventually lead to a better
understanding of the intentions implied in this seemingly arbitrary
disposition of animal life....</p>

<p>"There is still another very interesting problem respecting
the geographical distribution of our fresh-water animals which
may be solved by the further investigation of the fishes of the
Tennessee River. The water-course, taking the Powell, Clinch,
and Holston Rivers as its head waters, arises from the mountains
of Virginia in latitude 37&deg;; it then flows S.W. to latitude
34&deg; 25', when it turns W. and N.W., and finally empties into
the Ohio, under the same latitude as its source in 37&deg;.</p>

Ills. Family <i>Cyprinid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The question now is this: Are the fishes of this water system
the same throughout its extent? In which case we should
infer that water communication is the chief condition of geographical
distribution of our fresh-water fishes. Or do they
differ in different stations along its course? And if so, are the
differences mainly controlled by the elevation of the river above
the level of the sea, or determined by climatic differences corresponding
to differences of latitude? We should assume that
the first alternative was true if the fishes of the upper course
of the river differed from those of the middle and lower courses
in the same manner as in the Danube, from its source to Pesth,
where this stream flows nearly for its whole length under the
same parallel. We would, on the contrary, suppose the second
alternative to be well founded if marked differences were observed
between the fish of such tracts of the river as do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
materially differ in their evolution above the sea, but flow under
different latitudes. Now, a few collections from different stations
along this river, like that sent me by Dr. Newman from
the vicinity of Huntsville, would settle at once this question,
not for the Tennessee River alone, but for most rivers flowing
under similar circumstances upon the surface of the globe.
Nothing, however, short of such collections, compared closely
with one another, will furnish a reliable answer.... Whoever
will accomplish this survey will have made a highly valuable
contribution to our knowledge."</p>

<p><b>Conclusions of Cope.</b>&mdash;Certain conclusions were also suggested
by Prof. Cope in his excellent memoir on the fishes of
the Alleghany region<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> in 1868. From this paper I make the
following quotations:</p>

<p>"The distribution of fresh-water fishes is of special importance
to the questions of the origin and existence of species in
connection with the physical conditions of the waters and of
the land. This is, of course, owing to the restricted nature of
their habitat and the impossibility of their making extended
migrations. With the submergence of land beneath the sea,
fresh-water fish are destroyed in proportion to the extent of
the invasion of salt water, while terrestrial vertebrates can retreat
before it. Hence every inland fish fauna dates from the
last total submergence of the country.</p>

<p>"Prior to the elevation of a given mountain chain, the courses
of the rivers may generally have been entirely different from
their later ones. Subsequent to this period, they can only
have undergone partial modifications. As subsequent submergences
can rarely have extended to the highlands where
such streams originate, the fishes of such rivers can only have
been destroyed so far as they were unable to reach those elevated
regions, and preserve themselves from destruction from
salt water by sheltering themselves in mountain streams. On
the other hand, a period of greater elevation of the land, and
of consequent greater cold, would congeal the waters and
cover their courses with glaciers. The fishes would be driven
to the neighborhood of the coast, though no doubt in more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>southern latitudes a sufficient extent of uncongealed fresh
waters would flow by a short course into the ocean, to preserve
from destruction many forms of fresh-water fishes. Thus,
through many vicissitudes, the fauna of a given system of rivers
has had opportunity of uninterrupted descent, from the time
of the elevation of the mountain range, in which it has its
sources....</p>

<p>"As regards the distinction of species in the disconnected
basins of different rivers, which have been separated from an
early geologic period, if species occur which are common to
any two or more of them, the supporter of the theory of distinct
creations must suppose that such species have been twice
created, once for each hydrographic basin, or that waters flowing
into the one basin have been transferred to another. The
developmentalist, on the other hand, will accept the last proposition,
or else suppose that time has seen an identical process
and similar result of modification in these distinct regions.</p>

Yellowstone Park. Family <i>Cyprinid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Facts of distribution in the eastern district of North
America are these. Several species of fresh-water fishes occur
at the same time in many Atlantic basins from the Merrimac or
from the Hudson to the James, and throughout the Mississippi
Valley, and in the tributaries of the Great Lakes. On the other
hand, the species of each river may be regarded as pertaining
to four classes, whose distribution has direct reference to the
character of the water and the food it offers: first, those of the
tide-waters, of the river channels, bayous, and sluggish waters
near them, or in the flat lands near the coast; second, those of
the river channels of its upper course, where the currents are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
more distinct; third, those of the creeks of the hill country;
fourth, those of the elevated mountain streams which are subject
to falls and rapids."</p>

<p>In the same paper Prof. Cope reaches two important general
conclusions, thus stated by him:</p>

<p>"I. That species not generally distributed exist in waters
on different sides of the great watershed.</p>

<p>"II. That the distribution of the species is not governed
by the outlet of the rivers, streams having similar discharges
(Holston and Kanawha, Roanoke and Susquehanna) having
less in common than others having different outlets (Kanawha,
or Susquehanna and James).</p>

</div>

<p>"In view of the first proposition, and the question of the
origin of species, the possibility of an original or subsequent
mingling of the fresh waters suggests itself as more probable than
that of distinct origin in the different basins."</p>

<p><b>Questions Raised by Cope.</b>&mdash;Two questions in this connection
are raised by Prof. Cope. The first question is this: "Has
any destruction of the river faun&aelig; taken place since the first
elevation of the Alleghanies, when the same species were thrown
into waters flowing in opposite directions?" Of such destruction
by submergence or otherwise, Prof. Cope finds no evidence.
The second question is, "Has any means of communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
existed, at any time, but especially since the last submergence,
by which the transfer of species might occur?" Some evidence
of such transfer exists in the wide distribution of certain species,
especially those which seek the highest streamlets in the mountains;
but except to call attention to the cavernous character
of the Subcarboniferous and Devonian limestones, Prof. Cope
has made little attempt to account for it.</p>

<p>Prof. Cope finally concludes with this important generalization:</p>

<p>"It would appear, from the previous considerations, that
the distribution of fresh-water fishes is governed by laws similar
to those controlling terrestrial vertebrates and other animals,
in spite of the seemingly confined nature of their habitat."</p>

<p><b>Views of G&uuml;nther.</b>&mdash;Dr. G&uuml;nther<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> has well summarized some
of the known facts in regard to the manner of dispersion of
fishes:</p>

<p>"The ways in which the dispersal of fresh-water fishes has
been affected were various. They are probably all still in operation,
but most work so slowly and imperceptibly as to escape
direct observation; perhaps they will be more conspicuous after
science and scientific inquiry shall have reached a somewhat
greater age. From the great number of fresh-water forms
which we see at this present day acclimatized in, gradually
acclimatizing themselves in, or periodically or sporadically migrating
into, the sea, we must conclude that under certain circumstances
salt water may cease to be a barrier at some period
of the existence of fresh-water species, and that many of them
have passed from one river through salt water into another.
Secondly, the headwaters of some of the grandest rivers, the
mouths of which are at opposite ends of the continents which
they drain, are sometimes distant from each other a few miles
only. The intervening space may have been easily bridged
over for the passage of fishes by a slight geological change affecting
the level of the watershed or even by temporary floods; and
a communication of this kind, if existing for a limited period
only, would afford the ready means of an exchange of a number
of species previously peculiar to one or the other of these
river or lake systems. Some fishes provided with gill-openings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>so narrow that the water moistening the gills cannot readily
evaporate, and endowed, besides, with an extraordinary degree
of vitality, like many Siluroids (<i>Chlarias</i>, <i>Callichthys</i>), eels, etc.,
are enabled to wander for some distance over land, and may thus
reach a water-course leading them thousands of miles from
their original home. Finally, fishes or their ova may be accidentally
carried by water-spouts, by aquatic birds or insects,
to considerable distances."</p>

<p><b>Fresh-water Fishes of North America.</b>&mdash;We now recognize
about six hundred species<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> of fishes as found in the fresh waters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>of North America, north of the Tropic of Cancer, these representing
thirty-four of the natural families. As to their habits,
we can divide these species rather roughly into the four categories
proposed by Prof. Cope, or, as we may call them,</p>

<p>(1) Lowland fishes; as the bowfin,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> pirate-perch,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> large-mouthed

<p>(2) Channel-fishes; as the channel catfish,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> the mooneye,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>

<p>(3) Upland fishes; as many of the darters, shiners, and
suckers, and the small-mouthed black bass.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>(4) Mountain-fishes; as the brook trout and many of the
darters and minnows.</p>

<p>To these we may add the more or less distinct classes of (5)
lake fishes, inhabiting only waters which are deep, clear, and
cold, as the various species of whitefish<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and the Great Lake
trout;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> (6) anadromous fishes, or those which run up from
the sea to spawn in fresh waters, as the salmon,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> sturgeon,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
shad,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and striped bass;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> (7) catadromous fishes, like the
eel,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> which pass down to spawn in the sea; and (8) brackish-water
fishes, which thrive best in the debatable waters of the
river-mouths, as most of the sticklebacks and the killifishes.</p>

<p>As regards the range of species, we have every possible gradation
from those which seem to be confined to a single river,
and are rare even in their restricted habitat, to those which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>in a measure cosmopolitan,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> ranging everywhere in suitable
waters.</p>

<p><b>Characters of Species.</b>&mdash;Still, again, we have all degrees of
constancy and inconstancy in what we regard as the characters
of a species. Those found only in a single river-basin are
usually uniform enough; but the species having a wide range
usually vary much in different localities. Such variations
have at different times been taken to be the indications of as
many different species. Continued explorations bring to light,
from year to year, new species; but the number of new forms
now discovered each year is usually less than the number of
recognized species which are yearly proved to be untenable.
Four complete lists of the fresh-water fishes of the United States
(north of the Mexican boundary) have been published by the
present writer. That of Jordan and Copeland,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> published in
1876, enumerates 670 species. That of Jordan<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> in 1878 contains
665 species, and that of Jordan and Gilbert<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> in 1883, 587
species. That of Jordan and Evermann<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> in 1898 contains 585
species, although upwards of 130 new species were detected in
the twenty-two years which elapsed between the first and the last
list. Additional specimens from intervening localities are often
found to form connecting links among the nominal species, and
thus several supposed species become in time merged in one.
Thus the common channel catfish<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> of our rivers has been described
as a new species not less than twenty-five times, on
account of differences real or imaginary, but comparatively trifling
in value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Where species can readily migrate, their uniformity is preserved;
but whenever a form becomes localized its representatives
assume some characters not shared by the species as a
whole. When we can trace, as we often can, the disappearance
by degrees of these characters, such forms no longer represent
to us distinct species. In cases where the connecting forms are
extinct, or at least not represented in collections, each form
which is apparently different must be regarded as a distinct
species.</p>

<p>The variations in any type become, in general, more marked
as we approach the tropics. The genera are represented, on
the whole, by more species there, and it would appear that the
processes of specific change go on more rapidly under the easier
conditions of life in the Torrid Zone.</p>

<p>We recognize now in North America twenty-five distinct
species of fresh-water catfishes,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> although nearly a hundred (93)
nominal species of these fishes have been from time to time
described. But these twenty-five species are among themselves
very closely related, and all of them are subject to a variety
of minor changes. It requires no strong effort of the imagination
to see in them all the modified descendants of some one
species of catfish, not unlike our common "bullhead,"<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> an immigrant
probably from Asia, and which has now adjusted itself
to its surroundings in each of our myriad of catfish-breeding
streams.</p>

<p><b>Meaning of Species.</b>&mdash;The word "species," then, is simply a
term of convenience, including such members of a group similar
to each other as are tangibly different from others, and are not
known to be connected with these by intermediate forms.
Such connecting links we may suppose to have existed in all
cases. We are only sure that they do not now exist in our
collections, so far as these have been carefully studied.</p>

<p>When two or more species of any genus now inhabit the
same waters, they are usually species whose differentiation is of
long standing,&mdash;species, therefore, which can be readily distinguished
from one another. When, on the other hand, we
have "representative species,"&mdash;closely related forms, neither
of which is found within the geographical range of the other,&mdash;we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>can with some confidence look for intermediate forms where
the territory occupied by the one bounds that inhabited by the
other. In very many such cases the intermediate forms have
been found; and such forms are considered as subspecies of one
species, the one being regarded as the parent stock, the other
as an offshoot due to the influences of different environment.
Then, besides these "species" and "subspecies," groups more
or less readily recognizable, there are varieties and variations
of every grade, often too ill-defined to receive any sort of name,
but still not without significance to the student of the origin of
species. Comparing a dozen fresh specimens of almost any
kind of fish from any body of water with an equal number
from somewhere else, one will rarely fail to find some sort of
differences,&mdash;in size, in form, in color. These differences are obviously
the reflex of differences in the environment, and the
collector of fishes seldom fails to recognize them as such; often
it is not difficult to refer the effect to the conditions. Thus
fishes from grassy bottoms are darker than those taken from
over sand, and those from a bottom of muck are darker still,
the shade of color being, in some way not well understood, dependent
on the color of the surroundings. Fishes in large bodies
of water reach a larger size than the same species in smaller
streams or ponds. Fishes from foul or sediment-laden waters
are paler in color and slenderer in form than those from waters
which are clear and pure. Again, it is often true that specimens
from northern waters are less slender in body than those from
farther south; and so on. Other things being equal, the more
remote the localities from each other, the greater are these differences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>In our fresh-water fishes each species on an average has been
described as new from three to four times, on account of minor
variations, real or supposed. In Europe, where the fishes have
been studied longer and by more different men, upwards of six
or eight nominal species have been described for each one that
is now considered distinct.</p>

<p><b>Special Creation Impossible.</b>&mdash;It is evident, from these and
other facts, that the idea of a separate creation for each species
of fishes in each river-basin, as entertained by Agassiz, is wholly
incompatible with our present knowledge of the specific distinctions
or of the geographical distribution of fishes. This is
an unbroken gradation in the variations from the least to the
greatest,&mdash;from the peculiarities of the individual, through local
varieties, geographical subspecies, species, sub-genera, genera,
families, super-families, and so on, until all fish-like vertebrates
are included in a single bond of union.</p>

<p><b>Origin of American Species of Fishes.</b>&mdash;It is, however, evident
that not all American types of fishes had their origin in
America, or even first assumed in America their present forms.
Some of these are perhaps immigrants from northern Asia,
where they still have their nearest relatives. Still others are
evidently modified importations from the sea; and of these
some are very recent immigrants, land-locked species which have
changed very little from the parent stock.</p>

<p>The problems of analogous variation or parallelism without
homology are very often met with among fishes. In shallow,
swift brooks in all lands there are found small fishes which hug
the bottom&mdash;large-finned, swift of movement, with speckled
coloration, and with the air-bladder reduced in size. In the
eastern United States these fishes are darters, dwarf perches; in
northern India they are catfishes; in Japan, gobies or loaches; in
Canada, sculpins; in South America, characins. Members of
various groups may be modified to meet the same conditions
of life. Being modified to look alike, the thought of mutual
affinity is naturally suggested, but in such cases the likeness is
chiefly external. The internal organs show little trace of such
modifications. The inside of an animal tells what it really is,
the outside where it has been. In other words, it is the external
characters which are most readily affected by the environ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>ment.
Throughout all groups of animals and plants, there are
large branches similarly affected by peculiarities of conditions.</p>

<p>This is the basis of the law of "Adaptive Radiation." Prof.
H. F. Osborn thus states this law:</p>

<p>"It is a well-known principle of zoological evolution that an
isolated region, if large and sufficiently varied in its topography,
soil, climate, and vegetation, will give rise to a diversified fauna
according to the law of adaptive radiation from primitive and
central types. Branches will spring off in all directions to take
advantage of every possible opportunity of securing food. The
modifications which animals undergo in this adaptive radiation
are largely of mechanical nature; they are limited in number
and kind by hereditary stirp or germinal influences, and thus
result in the independent evolution of similar types in widely
separated regions under the law of parallelism or homoplasy."</p>

<p>
Total: Europe, 21 families; 126 species. North America, 34 families;
590 species. A few new species have been added since this enumeration was made.
</p>
<p>
According to Dr. G&uuml;nther (Guide to the Study of Fishes, p. 243), the total
number of species now known from the temperate regions of Asia and Europe
is about 360. The fauna of India, south of the Himalayas, is much more
extensive, numbering 625 species. This latter fauna bears little resemblance
to that of North America, being wholly tropical in its character.</p></div>

BARRIERS TO DISPERSION OF RIVER FISHES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_297.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Process of Natural Selection.</b>&mdash;We can say, in
general, that in all waters not absolutely uninhabitable
there are fishes. The processes of natural
selection have given to each kind of river or lake species of
fishes adapted to the conditions of life which obtain there.
There is no condition of water, of bottom, of depth, of speed
of current, but finds some species with characters adjusted
to it. These adjustments are, for the most part, of long standing;
and the fauna of any single stream has as a rule been
produced by immigration from other regions or from other
streams. Each species has an ascertainable range of distribution,
and within this range we may be reasonably certain to
find it in any suitable waters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_297.jpg" width="700" height="262" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 189.</span>&mdash;Slippery-dick or Doncella, <i>Halich&oelig;res bivittatus</i> Bloch, a fish of the
coral reefs, Key West. Family <i>Labrid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But every species has beyond question some sort of limit to
its distribution, some sort of barrier which it has never passed
in all the years of its existence. That this is true becomes
evident when we compare the fish fauna of widely separated
rivers. Thus the Sacramento, Connecticut, Rio Grande, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
St. John's Rivers have not a single species in common; and
with one or two exceptions, not a species is common to any
two of them. None of these<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> has any species peculiar to itself,
and each shares a large part of its fish fauna with the water-basin
next to it. It is probably true that the faunas of no two
distinct hydrographic basins are wholly identical, while on
the other hand there are very few species confined to a single
one. The supposed cases of this character, some twenty in
number, occur chiefly in the streams of the South Atlantic
States and of Arizona. All of these need, however, the confirmation
of further exploration. It is certain that in no case
has an entire river fauna<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> originated independently from the
divergence into separate species of the descendants of a single
type.</p>

<p>The existence of boundaries to the range of species implies,
therefore, the existence of barriers to their diffusion. We may
now consider these barriers and in the same connection the
degree to which they may be overcome.</p>

<p><b>Local Barriers.</b>&mdash;Least important to these are the barriers
which may exist within the limits of any single basin, and
which tend to prevent a free diffusion through its waters of
species inhabiting any portion of it. In streams flowing southward,
or across different parallels of latitude, the difference in
climate becomes a matter of importance. The distribution of
species is governed very largely by the temperature of the water.
Each species has its range in this respect,&mdash;the free-swimming
fishes, notably the trout, being most affected by it; the mud-loving
or bottom fishes, like the catfishes, least. The latter can
reach the cool bottoms in hot weather, or the warm bottoms in
cold weather, thus keeping their own temperature more even than
that of the surface of the water. Although water communication
is perfectly free for most of the length of the Mississippi,
there is a material difference between the faun&aelig; of the stream
in Minnesota and in Louisiana. This difference is caused chiefly
by the difference in temperature occupying the difference in
latitude. That a similar difference in longitude, with free
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>water communication, has no appreciable importance, is shown
by the almost absolute identity of the fish faun&aelig; of Lake Winnebago
and Lake Champlain. While many large fishes range
freely up and down the Mississippi, a majority of the species
do not do so, and the fauna of the upper Mississippi has more
in common with that of the tributaries of Lake Michigan than
it has with that of the Red River or the Arkansas. The influence
of climate is again shown in the paucity of the fauna
of the cold waters of Lake Superior, as compared with that
of Lake Michigan. The majority of our species cannot endure
the cold. In general, therefore, cold or Northern waters contain
fewer species than Southern waters do, though the number
of individuals of any one kind may be greater. This is
shown in all waters, fresh or salt. The fisheries of the Northern
seas are more extensive than those of the tropics. There are
more fishes there, but are far less varied in kind. The
writer once caught seventy-five species of fishes in a single
haul of the seine at Key West, while on Cape Cod he obtained
with the same net but forty-five species in the course of a week's
work. Thus it comes that the angler, contented with many
fishes of few kinds, goes to Northern streams to fish, while the
naturalist goes to the South.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 190.</span>&mdash;<i>Peristedion miniatum</i> Goode and Bean, a deep-red colored fish of

</div>

<p>But in most streams the difference in latitude is insignificant,
and the chief differences in temperature come from differences
in elevation, or from the distance of the waters from the colder
source. Often the lowland waters are so different in character
as to produce a marked change in the quality of their fauna.
These lowland waters may form a barrier to the free movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
of upland fishes; but that this barrier is not impassable is
shown by the identity of the fishes in the streams<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> of the uplands
of middle Tennessee with those of the Holston and French
Broad. Again, streams of the Ozark Mountains, similar in
character to the rivers of East Tennessee, have an essentially
similar fish fauna, although between the Ozarks and the Cumberland
range lies an area of lowland bayous, into which such
fishes are never known to penetrate. We can, however, imagine
that these upland fishes may be sometimes swept down
from one side or the other into the Mississippi, from which
they might ascend on the other side. But such transfers certainly
do not often happen. This is apparent from the fact
that the two faunas<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> are not quite identical, and in some cases
the same species are represented by perceptibly different varieties
on one side and the other. The time of the commingling of
these faun&aelig; is perhaps now past, and it may have occurred
only when the climate of the intervening regions was colder
than at present.</p>

<p>The effect of waterfalls and cascades as a barrier to the diffusion
of most species is self-evident; but the importance of
such obstacles is less, in the course of time, than might be expected.
In one way or another very many species have passed
these barriers. The falls of the Cumberland limit the range of
most of the larger fishes of the river, but the streams above it
have their quota of darters and minnows. It is evident that
the past history of the stream must enter as a factor into this
discussion, but this past history it is not always possible to
trace. Dams or artificial waterfalls now check the free movement
of many species, especially those of migratory habits;
while conversely, numerous other species have extended their
range through the agency of canals.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Every year fishes are swept down the rivers by the winter's
floods; and in the spring, as the spawning season approaches,
almost every species is found working its way up the stream.
In some cases, notably the Quinnat salmon<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and the blue-back
salmon,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> the length of these migrations is surprisingly great.
To some species rapids and shallows have proved a sufficient
barrier, and other kinds have been kept back by unfavorable
conditions of various sorts. Streams whose waters are always
charged with silt or sediment, as the Missouri, Arkansas, or
Brazos, do not invite fishes; and even the occasional floods of
red mud such as disfigure otherwise clear streams, like the Red
River or the Colorado (of Texas), are unfavorable. Extremely
unfavorable also is the condition which obtains in many rivers
of the Southwest, as, for example, the Red River, the Sabine,
and the Trinity, which are full from bank to bank in winter
and spring, and which dwindle to mere rivulets in the autumn
droughts.</p>

<p><b>Favorable Waters have Most Species.</b>&mdash;In general, those streams
which have conditions most favorable to fish life will be found
to contain the greatest number of species. Such streams invite
immigration; and in them the struggle for existence is individual
against individual, species against species, and not a
mere struggle with hard conditions of life. Some of the conditions
most favorable to the existence in any stream of a large
number of species of fishes are the following, the most important
of which is the one mentioned first: Connection with a large
hydrographic basin; a warm climate; clear water; a moderate
current; a bottom of gravel (preferably covered by a growth
of weeds); little fluctuation during the year in the volume of
the stream or in the character of the water.</p>

<p>Limestone streams usually yield more species than streams
flowing over sandstone, and either more than the streams of
regions having metamorphic rocks. Sandy bottoms usually are
not favorable to fishes. In general, glacial drift makes a suitable
river bottom, but the higher temperature usual in regions
beyond the limits of the drift gives to certain Southern streams
conditions still more favorable. These conditions are all well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>realized in the Washita River in Arkansas, and in various tributaries
of the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Ohio; and in these,
among American streams, the greatest number of species has
been recorded.</p>

<p>The isolation and the low temperature of the rivers of New
England have given to them a very scanty fish fauna as compared
with the rivers of the South and West. This fact has
been noticed by Professor Agassiz, who has called New England
a "zoological island."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the fact that barriers of every sort are sometimes
crossed by fresh-water fishes, we must still regard the
matter of freedom of water communication as the essential one
in determining the range of most species. The larger the river
basin, the greater the variety of conditions likely to be offered
in it, and the greater the number of its species. In case of the
divergence of new forms by the processes called "natural selection,"
the greater the number of such forms which may have
spread through its waters; the more extended any river basin,
the greater are the chances that any given species may sometimes
find its way into it; hence the greater the number of
species that actually occur in it, and, freedom of movement
being assumed, the greater the number of species to be found
in any one of its affluents.</p>

<p>Of the six hundred species of fishes found in the rivers of the
United States, about two hundred have been recorded from
the basin of the Mississippi. From fifty to one hundred of
these species can be found in any one of the tributary streams
of the size, say, of the Housatonic River or the Charles. In
the Connecticut River there are but about eighteen species permanently
resident; and the number found in the streams of
Texas is not much larger, the best known of these, the Rio
Colorado, having yielded but twenty-four species.</p>

<p>The waters of the Great Basin are not rich in fishes, the</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
species now found being evidently an overflow from the Snake
River when in late glacial times it drained Lake Bonneville.
This postglacial lake once filled the present basin of the Great
Salt Lake and Utah Lake, its outlet flowing northwest from
Ogden into Snake River. The same fishes are now found in
the upper Snake River and the basins of Utah Lake and of
Sevier Lake. In the same fashion Lake Lahontan once occupied
the basin of Nevada, the Humboldt and Carson sinks, with
Pyramid Lake. Its drainage fell also into the Snake River,
and its former limits are shown in the present range of species.
These have almost nothing in common with the group of species
inhabiting the former drainage of Lake Bonneville. Another
postglacial body of water, Lake Idaho, once united the lakes
of Southeastern Oregon. The fauna of Lake Idaho, and of the
lakes Malheur, Warner, Goose, etc., which have replaced it, is
also isolated and distinctive. The number of species now known
from this region of these ancient lobes is about 125. This list is
composed almost entirely of a few genera of suckers,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> minnows,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
and trout.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> None of the catfishes, perch, darters, or sunfishes,
moon-eyes, pike, killifishes, and none of the ordinary Eastern
types of minnows<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> have passed the barrier of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>West of the Sierra Nevada the fauna is still more scanty,
only about seventy species being enumerated. This fauna, except
for certain immigrants<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> from the sea, is of the same general
character as that of the Great Basin, though most of the species
are different. This latter fact would indicate a considerable
change, or "evolution," since the contents of the two faun&aelig;
were last mingled. There is a considerable difference between
the fauna of the Columbia and that of the Sacramento. The
species which these two basins have in common are chiefly
those which at times pass out into the sea. The rivers of Alaska
contain but few species, barely a dozen in all, most of these
being found also in Siberia and Kamchatka. In the scantiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>of its faunal list, the Yukon agrees with the Mackenzie
River, and with Arctic rivers generally.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the general tendency is for
each species to extend its range more and more widely until
all localities suitable for its growth are included. The various
agencies of dispersal which have existed in the past are still
in operation. There is apparently no limit to their action.
It is probable that new "colonies" of one species or another
may be planted each year in waters not heretofore inhabited
by such species. But such colonies become permanent only
where the conditions are so favorable that the species can hold
its own in the struggle for food and subsistence. That the
various modifications in the habitat of certain species have been
caused by human agencies is of course too well known to need
discussion here.</p>

<p><b>Watersheds.</b>&mdash;We may next consider the question of watersheds,
or barriers which separate one river basin from another.</p>

<p>Of such barriers in the United States, the most important
and most effective is unquestionably that of the main chain
of the Rocky Mountains. This is due in part to its great
height, still more to its great breadth, and most of all, perhaps,
to the fact that it is nowhere broken by the passage of a river.
But two species&mdash;the red-throated or Rocky Mountain trout<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
and the Rocky Mountain whitefish<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>&mdash;are found on both sides
of it, at least within the limits of the United States; while many
genera, and even several families, find in it either an eastern or a
western limit to their range. In a few instances representative
species, probably modifications or separated branches of the
same stock, occur on opposite sides of the range, but there are
not many cases of correspondence even thus close. The two
faunas are practically distinct. Even the widely distributed
red-spotted or "dolly varden" trout<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> of the Columbia River
and its affluents does not cross to the east side of the mountains,
nor does the Montana grayling<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> ever make its way to the
West. In Northern Mexico, however, numerous Eastern river
fishes have crossed the main chain of the Sierra Madre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p><b>How Fishes Cross Watersheds.</b>&mdash;It is easy to account for
this separation of the faun&aelig;; but how shall we explain the
almost universal diffusion of the whitefish and the trout in
suitable waters on both sides of the dividing ridge? We may
notice that these two are the species which ascend highest in
the mountains, the whitefish inhabiting the mountain pools
and lakes, the trout ascending all brooks and rapids in search of
their fountainheads. In many cases the ultimate dividing ridge
is not very broad, and we may imagine that at some time spawn
or even young fishes may have been carried across by birds or
other animals, or by man, or more likely by the dash of some
summer whirlwind. Once carried across in favorable circumstances,
the species might survive and spread.</p>

<p>The following is an example of how such transfer of species
may be accomplished, which shows that we need not be
left to draw on the imagination to invent possible means of
transit.</p>

<p><b>The Suletind.</b>&mdash;There are few watersheds in the world
better defined than the mountain range which forms the "back-bone"
of Norway. I lately climbed a peak in this range, the
Suletind. From its summit I could look down into the valleys
of the L&auml;ra and the B&auml;gna, flowing in opposite directions to opposite
sides of the peninsula. To the north of the Suletind is
a large double lake called the Sletningenvand. The maps show
this lake to be one of the chief sources of the westward-flowing
river L&auml;ra. This lake is in August swollen by the melting of
the snows, and at the time of my visit it was visibly the source
of both these rivers. From its southeastern side flowed a
large brook into the valley of the B&auml;gna, and from its southwestern
corner, equally distinctly, came the waters which fed
the L&auml;ra. This lake, like similar mountain ponds in all northern
countries, abounds in trout; and these trout certainly have
for part of the year an uninterrupted line of water communication
from the Sognefjord on the west of Norway to the Christianiafjord
on the southeast,&mdash;from the North Sea to the Baltic.
Part of the year the lake has probably but a single outlet
through the L&auml;ra. A higher temperature would entirely cut
off the flow into the B&auml;gna, and a still higher one might dry
up the lake altogether. This Sletningenvand, with its two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
outlets on the summit of a sharp watershed, may serve to
show us how other lakes, permanent or temporary, may elsewhere
have acted as agencies for the transfer of fishes. We
can also see how it might be that certain mountain fishes should
be so transferred while the fishes of the upland waters may
be left behind. In some such way as this we may imagine that
various species of fishes have attained their present wide range
in the Rocky Mountain region; and in similar manner perhaps
the Eastern brook trout<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and some other mountain species<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
may have been carried across the Alleghanies.</p>

<p><b>The Cassiquiare.</b>&mdash;Professor John C. Branner calls my attention
to a marshy upland which separates the valley of the La
Plata from that of the Amazon, and which permits the free
movement of fishes from the Paraguay River to the Tapajos.
It is well known that through the Cassiquiare River the Rio
Negro, another branch of the Amazon, is joined to the Orinoco
River. It is thus evident that almost all the waters of eastern
South America form a single basin, so far as the fishes are concerned.</p>

<p>As to the method of transfer of the trout from the Columbia
to the Missouri, we are not now left in doubt.</p>

<p><b>Two-Ocean Pass.</b>&mdash;To this day, as the present writer and
later Evermann and Jenkins<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> have shown, the Yellowstone and
Snake Rivers are connected by two streams crossing the main
divide of the Rocky Mountains from the Yellowstone to the Snake
across Two-Ocean Pass.</p>

<p>Prof. Evermann has described the locality as follows:</p>

<p>"Two-Ocean Pass is a high mountain meadow, about 8,200
feet above the sea and situated just south of the Yellowstone
National Park, in longitude 110&deg; 10' W., latitude 44&deg; 3' N.
It is surrounded on all sides by rather high mountains except
where the narrow valleys of Atlantic and Pacific creeks open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>out from it. Running back among the mountains to the northward
are two small canyons down which come two small streams.
On the opposite is another canyon down which comes another
small stream. The extreme length of the meadow from east
to west is about a mile, while the width from north to south
is not much less. The larger of the streams coming in from
the north is Pacific Creek, which, after winding along the western
side of the meadow, turns abruptly westward, leaving the meadow
through a narrow gorge. Receiving numerous small affluents,
Pacific Creek soon becomes a good-sized stream, which finally
unites with Buffalo Creek a few miles above where the latter
stream flows into Snake River.</p>

<p>"Atlantic Creek was found to have two forks entering the
pass. At the north end of the meadow is a small wooded canyon
down which flows the North Fork. This stream hugs the border
of the flat very closely. The South Fork comes down the
canyon on the south side, skirting the brow of the hill a little
less closely than does the North Fork. The two, coming together
near the middle of the eastern border of the meadow,
form Atlantic Creek, which after a course of a few miles flows
into the Upper Yellowstone. But the remarkable phenomena
exhibited here remain to be described.</p>

<p>"Each fork of Atlantic Creek, just after entering the
meadow, divides as if to flow around an island, but the stream
toward the meadow, instead of returning to the portion from
which it had parted, continues its westerly course across the
meadow. Just before reaching the western border the two
streams unite and then pour their combined waters into Pacific
Creek; thus are Atlantic and Pacific creeks united and a continuous
waterway from the Columbia via Two-Ocean Pass to
the Gulf of Mexico is established.</p>

<p>"Pacific Creek is a stream of good size long before it enters
the pass, and its course through the meadow is in a definite
channel, but not so with Atlantic Creek. The west bank of
each fork is low and the stream is liable to break through anywhere
and thus send part of its water across to Pacific Creek.
It is probably true that one or two branches always connect
the two creeks under ordinary conditions, and that following
heavy rains or when the snows are melting, a much greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
portion of the water of Atlantic Creek crosses the meadow
to the other side.</p>

</div>

<p>"Besides the channels already mentioned, there are several
more or less distinct ones that were dry at the time of our visit.
As already stated, the pass is a nearly level meadow covered
with a heavy growth of grass and many small willows one to
three feet high. While it is somewhat marshy in places it has
nothing of the nature of a lake about it. Of course, during
wet weather the small springs at the borders of the meadow
would be stronger, but the important facts are that there is
no lake or even marsh there and that neither Atlantic nor
Pacific Creek has its rise in the meadow. Atlantic Creek, in
fact, comes into the pass as two good-sized streams from opposite
directions and leaves it by at least four channels, thus
making an island of a considerable portion of the meadow.
And it is certain that there is, under ordinary circumstances,
a continuous waterway through Two-Ocean Pass of such a
character as to permit fishes to pass easily and readily from
Snake River over to the Yellowstone, or in the opposite direction.
Indeed, it is quite possible, barring certain falls in the
Snake River, for a fish so inclined, to start at the mouth of the
Columbia, travel up that great river to its principal tributary,
the Snake, thence on through the long, tortuous course of that
stream, and, under the shadows of the Grand Teton, enter the
cold waters of Pacific Creek, by which it could journey on up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
the very crest of the great continental divide,&mdash;to Two-Ocean
Pass; through this pass it may have a choice of two routes to
Atlantic Creek, in which the down-stream journey is begun. Soon
it reaches the Yellowstone, down which it continues to Yellowstone
Lake, then through the lower Yellowstone out into
the turbid waters of the Missouri; for many hundred miles it
may continue down this mighty river before reaching the
Father of Waters, which will finally carry it to the Gulf of
Mexico&mdash;a wonderful journey of nearly 6,000 miles, by far the
longest possible fresh-water journey in the world.</p>

<p>"We found trout in Pacific Creek at every point where we
examined it. In Two-Ocean Pass we found trout in each of
the streams and in such positions as would have permitted
them to pass easily from one side of the divide to the other.
We also found trout in Atlantic Creek below the pass, and in
the upper Yellowstone they were abundant. Thus it is certain
that there is no obstruction, even in dry weather, to prevent
the passage of trout from the Snake River to Yellowstone
Lake; it is quite evident that trout do pass over in this way;
and it is almost certain that Yellowstone Lake was stocked with
trout from the west via Two-Ocean Pass."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Evermann.</span></p>

<p><b>Mountain Chains.</b>&mdash;The Sierra Nevada constitutes also a
very important barrier to the diffusion of species. This is,
however, broken by the passage of the Columbia River, and
many species thus find their way across it. That the waters
to the west of it are not unfavorable for the growth of
Eastern fishes is shown by the fact of the rapid spread of the common
Eastern catfish,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> or horned pout, when transported from
the Schuylkill to the Sacramento. The catfish is now one of the
important food fishes of the San Francisco markets, and with
the Chinaman its patron, it has gone from California to Hawaii.
The Chinese catfish, described by Bleeker as <i>Ameiurus cantonensis</i>,
was doubtless carried home by some Chinaman returning
from San Francisco. In like fashion the small-mouthed
black bass is now frequent in California streams, as is also the
blue-green sunfish, <i>Apomotis cyanellus</i>, introduced as food for
the bass.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>
<p>The mountain mass of Mount Shasta is, as already stated,
a considerable barrier to the range of fishes, though a number
of species find their way around it through the sea. The lower
and irregular ridges of the Coast Range are of small importance
in this regard, as the streams of their east slope reach the sea
on the west through San Francisco Bay. Yet the San Joaquin
contains a few species not yet recorded from the smaller rivers
of southwestern California.</p>

<p>The main chain of the Alleghanies forms a barrier of importance
separating the rich fish fauna of the Tennessee and
Ohio basins from the scantier faun&aelig; of the Atlantic streams.
Yet this barrier is crossed by many more species than is the
case with either the Rocky Mountains or the Sierra Nevada. It
is lower, narrower, and much more broken,&mdash;as in New York,
in Pennsylvania, and in Georgia there are several streams which
pass through it or around it. The much greater age of the
Alleghany chain, as compared with the Rocky Mountains, seems
not to be an element of any importance in this connection. Of
the fish which cross this chain, the most prominent is the brook
trout,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> which is found in all suitable waters from Hudson's
Bay to the head of the Chattahoochee.</p>

<p><b>Upland Fishes.</b>&mdash;A few other species are locally found in
the head waters of certain streams on opposite sides of the range.
An example of this is the little red "fallfish,"<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> found only in the
mountain tributaries of the Savannah and the Tennessee. We
may suppose the same agencies to have assisted these species
that we have imagined in the case of the Rocky Mountain trout,
and such agencies were doubtless more operative in the times
immediately following the glacial epoch than they are now.
Prof. Cope calls attention also to the numerous caverns existing
in these mountains as a sufficient medium for the transfer of
many species. I doubt whether the main chains of the Blue
Ridge or the Great Smoky can be crossed in that way, though
such channels are not rare in the subcarboniferous limestones
of the Cumberland range. In the brooks at the head waters of
the Roanoke River about Alleghany Springs in Virginia, fishes
of the Tennessee Basin are found, instead of those characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>of the lower Roanoke. In this case it is likely that we have
to consider the results of local erosion. Probably the divide has
been so shifted that some small stream with its fishes has been
cut off from the Holston and transferred to the Roanoke.</p>

<p>The passage of species from stream to stream along the
Atlantic slope deserves a moment's notice. It is under present
conditions impossible for any mountain or upland fish, as the
trout or the miller's thumb,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> to cross from the Potomac River
to the James, or from the Neuse to the Santee, by descending
to the lower courses of the rivers, and thence passing along
either through the swamps or by way of the sea. The lower
courses of these streams, warm and muddy, are uninhabitable
by such fishes. Such transfers are, however, possible farther
north. From the rivers of Canada and from many rivers of
New England the trout does descend to the sea and into the
sea, and farther north the whitefish does this also. Thus these
fishes readily pass from one river basin to another. As this is
the case now everywhere in the North, it may have been the
case farther south in the time of the glacial cold. We may, I
think, imagine a condition of things in which the snow-fields
of the Alleghany chain might have played some part in aiding
the diffusion of cold-loving fishes. A permanent snow-field on
the Blue Ridge in western North Carolina might render almost
any stream in the Carolinas suitable for trout, from its source
to its mouth. An increased volume of colder water might carry
the trout of the head streams of the Catawba and the Savannah
as far down as the sea. We can even imagine that the trout
reached these streams in the first place through such agencies,
though of this there is no positive evidence. For the presence
of trout in the upper Chattahoochee we must account in some
other way.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the upland fishes are nearly the same
in all these streams until we reach the southern limit of possible
glacial influence. South of western North Carolina the faun&aelig;
of the different river basins appear to be more distinct from
one another. Certain ripple-loving types are represented by
closely related but unquestionably different species in each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>river basin, and it would appear that a thorough mingling of
the upland species in these rivers has never taken place.</p>

<p>The best examples of this are the following: In the Santee
basin are found <i>Notropis pyrrhomelas</i>, <i>Notropis niveus</i>, and <i>Notropis
chloristius</i>; in the Altamaha, <i>Notropis x&aelig;nurus</i> and <i>Notropis
callisemus</i>; in the Chattahoochee, <i>Notropis hypselopterus</i> and
<i>Notropis eurystomus</i>; in the Alabama, <i>Notropis c&oelig;ruleus</i>, <i>Notropis
trichroistius</i>, and <i>Notropis callistius</i>. In the Alabama, Escambia,
Pearl, and numerous other rivers is found <i>Notropis cercostigma</i>.
This species descends to the sea in the cool streams of
the pine woods. Its range is wider than that of the others, and
in the rivers of Texas it reappears in the form of a scarcely distinct
variety, <i>Notropis venustus</i>. In the Tennessee and Cumberland,
and in the rivers of the Ozark range, is <i>Notropis galacturus</i>;
and in the upper Arkansas <i>Notropis camurus</i>,&mdash;all distinct species
of the same general type. Northward, in all the streams from
the Potomac to the Oswego, and westward to the Des Moines and
the Arkansas, occurs a single species of this type, <i>Notropis
whipplei</i>, varying eastward into <i>Notropis analostanus</i>. But this
species is not known from any of the streams inhabited by any
of the other species mentioned, although very likely it is the
parent stock of them all.</p>

<p><b>Lowland Fishes.</b>&mdash;With the lowland species of the Southern
rivers it is different. Few of these are confined within narrow
limits. The streams of the whole South Atlantic and Gulf
Coast flow into shallow bays, mostly bounded by sand-spits or
sand-bars which the rivers themselves have brought down. In
these bays the waters are often neither fresh nor salt; or, rather,
they are alternately fresh and salt, the former condition being
that of the winter and spring. Many species descend into these
bays, thus finding every facility for transfer from river to river.
There is a continuous inland passage in fresh or brackish waters,
traversable by such fishes, from Chesapeake Bay nearly to
Cape Fear; and similar conditions exist on the coasts of Louisiana,
Texas, and much of Florida. In Perdido Bay I have found
fresh-water minnows<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and silversides<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> living together with
marine gobies<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and salt-water eels.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Fresh-water alligator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>gars<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and marine sharks compete for the garbage thrown over
from the Pensacola wharves. In Lake Pontchartrain the fauna
is a remarkable mixture of fresh-water fishes from the Mississippi
and marine fishes from the Gulf. Channel-cats, sharks,
sea-crabs, sunfishes, and mullets can all be found there together.
It is therefore to be expected that the lowland fauna
of all the rivers of the Gulf States would closely resemble that
of the lower Mississippi; and this, in fact, is the case.</p>

<p>The streams of southern Florida and those of southwestern
Texas offer some peculiarities connected with their warmer
climate. The Florida streams contain a few peculiar fishes;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
while the rivers of Texas, with the same general fauna as those
farther north, have also a few distinctly tropical types,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> immigrants
from the lowlands of Mexico.</p>

<p><b>Cuban Fishes.</b>&mdash;The fresh waters of Cuba are inhabited by
fishes unlike those found in the United States. Some of these
are evidently indigenous, derived in the waters they now inhabit
directly from marine forms. Two of these are eyeless
species,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> inhabiting streams in the caverns. They have no
relatives in the fresh waters of any other region, the blind
fishes<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> of our caves being of a wholly different type. Some of
the Cuban fishes are common to the fresh waters of the other
West Indies. Of Northern types, only one, the alligator gar,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
is found in Cuba, and this is evidently a filibuster immigrant from
the coasts of Florida.</p>

<p><b>Swampy Watersheds.</b>&mdash;The low and irregular watershed
which separates the tributaries of Lake Michigan and Lake
Erie from those of the Ohio is of little importance in determining
the range of species. Many of the distinctively Northern fishes
are found in the headwaters of the Wabash and the Scioto.
The considerable difference in the general fauna of the Ohio
Valley as compared with that of the streams of Michigan is due
to the higher temperature of the former region, rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>to any existing barriers between the river and the Great Lakes.
In northern Indiana the watershed is often swampy, and in
many places large ponds exist in the early spring.</p>

<p>At times of heavy rains many species will move through considerable
distances by means of temporary ponds and brooks.
Fishes that have thus emigrated often reach places ordinarily
inaccessible, and people finding them in such localities often
imagine that they have "rained down." Once, near Indianapolis,
after a heavy shower, I found in a furrow in a corn-field
a small pike,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> some half a mile from the creek in which he
should belong. The fish was swimming along in a temporary
brook, apparently wholly unconscious that he was not in his
native stream. Migratory fishes, which ascend small streams to
spawn, are especially likely to be transferred in this way. By
some such means any of the watersheds in Ohio, Indiana, or
Illinois may be passed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>

<p>It is certain that the limits of Lake Erie and Lake Michigan
were once more extended than now. It is reasonably probable
that some of the territory now drained by the Wabash
and the Illinois was once covered by the waters of Lake Michigan.
The cisco<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> of Lake Tippecanoe, Lake Geneva, and the
lakes of the Oconomowoc chain is evidently a modified descendant
of the so-called lake herring.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Its origin most likely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>dates from the time when these small deep lakes of Indiana
and Wisconsin were connected with Lake Michigan. The
changes in habits which the cisco has undergone are considerable.
The changes in external characters are but trifling. The
presence of the cisco in these lakes and its periodical disappearance&mdash;that
is, retreat into deep water when not in the breeding
season&mdash;have given rise to much nonsensical discussion as to
whether any or all of these lakes are still joined to Lake Michigan
by subterranean channels. Several of the larger fishes, properly
characteristic of the Great Lake region,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> are occasionally taken
in the Ohio River, where they are usually recognized as rare
stragglers. The difference in physical conditions is probably the
sole cause of their scarcity in the Ohio basin.</p>

<p><b>The Great Basin of Utah.</b>&mdash;The similarity of the fishes in the
different streams and lakes of the Great Basin is doubtless to be
attributed to the general mingling of their waters which took
place during and after the Glacial Epoch. Since that period the
climate in that region has grown hotter and drier, until the overflow
of the various lakes into the Columbia basin through the
Snake River has long since ceased. These lakes have become
isolated from each other, and many of them have become salt
or alkaline and therefore uninhabitable. In some of these lakes
certain species may now have become extinct which still remain
in others. In some cases, perhaps, the differences in surroundings
may have caused divergence into distinct species of what was
once one parent stock. The suckers in Lake Tahoe<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and those
in Utah Lake are certainly now different from each other and from
those in the Columbia. The trout<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> in the same waters can be
regarded as more or less tangible species, while the whitefishes<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
show no differences at all. The differences in the present
faunas of Lake Tahoe and Utah Lake must be chiefly due to
influences which have acted since the Glacial Epoch, when the
whole Utah Basin was part of the drainage of the Columbia.</p>

<p><b>Arctic Species in Lakes.</b>&mdash;Connected perhaps with changes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>due to glacial influences is the presence in the deep waters of the
Great Lakes of certain marine types,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> as shown by the explorations
of Professor Sidney I. Smith and others. One of these is a
genus of fishes,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> of which the nearest allies now inhabit the Arctic
Seas. In his review of the fish fauna of Finland,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Professor A. J.
Malmgren finds a number of Arctic species in the waters of Finland
which are not found either in the North Sea or in the southern
portions of the Baltic. These fishes are said to "agree with their
'forefathers' in the Glacial Ocean in every point, but remain
comparatively smaller, leaner, almost starved." Professor Lov&eacute;n<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
also has shown that numerous small animals of marine origin are
found in the deep lakes of Sweden and Finland as well as in the
Gulf of Bothnia. These anomalies of distribution are explained
by Lov&eacute;n and Malmgren on the supposition of the former continuity
of the Baltic through the Gulf of Bothnia with the Glacial
Ocean. During the second half of the Glacial Period, according
to Lov&eacute;n, "the greater part of Finland and of the middle of
Sweden was submerged, and the Baltic was a great gulf of the
Glacial Ocean, and not connected with the German Ocean. By
the gradual elevation of the Scandinavian Continent, the Baltic
became disconnected from the Glacial Ocean and the Great
Lakes separated from the Baltic. In consequence of the gradual
change of the salt water into fresh, the marine fauna became
gradually extinct, with the exception of the glacial forms mentioned
above."</p>

<p>It is possible that the presence of marine types in our Great
Lakes is to be regarded as due to some depression of the land
which would connect their waters with those of the Gulf of St.
Lawrence. On this point, however, our data are still incomplete.</p>

<p>To certain species of upland or mountain fishes the depression
of the Mississippi basin itself forms a barrier which cannot be
passed. The black-spotted trout,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> very closely related species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>of which abound in all waters of northern Asia, Europe, and
western North America, has nowhere crossed the basin of the
Mississippi, although one of its species finds no difficulty in passing
Bering Strait. The trout and whitefish of the Rocky Mountain
region are all species different from those of the Great Lakes
or the streams of the Alleghany system. To the grayling, the
trout, the whitefish, the pike, and to arctic and subarctic
species generally, Bering Strait has evidently proved no serious
obstacle to diffusion; and it is not unlikely that much of the close
resemblance of the fresh-water faun&aelig; of northern Europe, Asia,
and North America is due to this fact. To attempt to decide
from which side the first migration came in regard to each group
of fishes might be interesting; but without a wider range of facts
than is now in our possession, most such attempts, based on guesswork,
would have little value. The interlocking of the fish faunas
of Asia and North America presents, however, a number of interesting
problems, for migrations in both directions have doubtless
taken place.</p>

<p><b>Causes of Dispersion Still in Operation.</b>&mdash;One might go on
indefinitely with the discussion of special cases, each more or less
interesting or suggestive in itself, but the general conclusion is in
all cases the same. The present distribution of fishes is the result
of the long-continued action of forces still in operation. The
species have entered our waters in many invasions from the Old
World or from the sea. Each species has been subjected to the
various influences implied in the term "natural selection," and
under varying conditions its representatives have undergone
many different modifications. Each of the six hundred fresh-water
species we now know in the United States may be conceived
as making every year inroads on territory occupied by
other species. If these colonies are able to hold their own in
the struggle for possession, they will multiply in the new conditions,
and the range of the species becomes widened. If the
surroundings are different, new species or varieties may be formed
with time; and these new forms may again invade the territory
of the parent species. Again, colony after colony of species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>after species may be destroyed by other species or by uncongenial
surroundings.</p>

<p>The ultimate result of centuries on centuries of the restlessness
of individuals is seen in the facts of geographical distribution.
Only in the most general way can the history of any species be
traced; but could we know it all, it would be as long and as eventful
a story as the history of the colonization and settlement of
North America by immigrants from Europe. But by the fishes
each river in America has been a hundred times discovered, its
colonization a hundred times attempted. In these efforts there
is no co-operation. Every individual is for himself, every struggle
a struggle of life and death; for each fish is a cannibal, and to each
species each member of every other species is an alien and a
savage.</p>

FISHES AS FOOD FOR MAN</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_320.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Flesh of Fishes.</b>&mdash;Among all races of men, fishes
are freely eaten as food, either raw, as preferred by
the Japanese and Hawaiians, or else as cooked,
salted, dried, or otherwise preserved.</p>

<p>The flesh of most fishes is white, flaky, readily digestible,
and with an agreeable flavor. Some, as the salmon, are charged
with oil, which aids to give an orange hue known as salmon
color. Others have colorless oil which may be of various consistencies.
Some have dark-red flesh, which usually contains
a heavy oil which becomes acrid when stale. Some fishes, as
the sharks, have tough, coarse flesh. Some have flesh which is
watery and coarse. Some are watery and tasteless, some dry
and tasteless. Some, otherwise excellent, have the muscular
area, which constitutes the chief edible part of the fish, filled
with small bones.</p>

<p><b>Relative Rank of Food-fishes.</b>&mdash;The writer has tested most
of the noted food-fishes of the Northern Hemisphere. When
properly cooked (for he is no judge of raw fish) he would place
first in the ranks as a food-fish the eulachon, or candle-fish
(<i>Thaleichthys pacificus</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 194.</span>&mdash;Eulachon, or Ulchen. <i>Thaleichthys pretiosus</i> Girard. Columbia River.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>This little smelt, about a foot long, ascends the Columbia
River, Frazer River, and streams of southern Alaska in the
spring in great numbers for the purpose of spawning. Its flesh
is white, very delicate, charged with a white and very agreeable
oil, readily digested, and with a sort of fragrance peculiar
to the species.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_321-195.jpg" width="700" height="339" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 195.</span>&mdash;Ayu, or Japanese Samlet, <i>Plecoglossus altivelis</i> Schlegel. Tanagawa,
Tokyo, Japan.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Next to this he is inclined to place the ayu (<i>Plecoglossus
altivelis</i>), a sort of dwarf salmon which runs in similar fashion
in the rivers of Japan and Formosa. The ayu is about as large
as the eulachon and has similar flesh, but with little oil and no
fragrance.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 196.</span>&mdash;Whitefish, <i>Coregonus clupeiformis</i> Mitchill. Ecorse, Mich.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Very near the first among sea-fishes must come the pampano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
(<i>Trachinotus carolinus</i>) of the Gulf of Mexico, with firm, white,
finely flavored flesh.</p>

<p>The red surmullet of Europe (<i>Mullus barbatus</i>) has been
long famed for its delicate flesh, and may perhaps be placed
next. Two related species in Polynesia, the munu and the
kumu (<i>Pseudupeneus bifasciatus</i> and <i>Pseudupeneus porphyreus</i>),
are scarcely inferior to it.</p>

</div>

<p>Side by side with these belongs the whitefish of the Great
Lakes (<i>Coregonus clupeiformis</i>). Its flesh, delicate, slightly
gelatinous, moderately oily, is extremely agreeable. Sir John
Richardson records the fact that one can eat the flesh of this
fish longer than any other without the feeling of cloying. The
salmon cannot be placed in the front ranks because, however
excellent, the stomach soon becomes tired of it. The Spanish
mackerel (<i>Scomberomorus maculatus</i>), with flesh at once rich and
delicate, the great opah (<i>Lampris luna</i>), still richer and still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
more delicate, the bluefish (<i>Pomatomus saltatrix</i>) similar but a
little coarser, the ulua (<i>Carangus sem</i>), the finest large food-fish
of the South Seas, the dainty California poppy-fish, miscalled
"Pampano" (<i>Palometa simillima</i>), and the kingfish firm and
well-flavored (<i>Scomberomorus cavalla</i>), represent the best of the
fishes allied to the mackerel.</p>

</div>

<p>The shad (<i>Alosa sapidissima</i>), with its sweet, tender, finely
oily flesh, stands also near the front among food-fishes, but it
sins above all others in the matter of small bones. The weak-fish
(<i>Cynoscion nobilis</i>) and numerous relatives rank first among
those with tender, white, savorous flesh. Among the bass and
perch-like fishes, common consent places near the first the
striped bass (<i>Roccus lineatus</i>), the bass of Europe (<i>Dicentrarchus
labrax</i>), the susuki of Japan (<i>Lateolabrax japonicus</i>), the red
tai of Japan (<i>Pagrus major</i> and <i>P. cardinalis</i>), the sheep's-head

<p>The various kinds of trout have been made famous the world
over. All are attractive in form and color; all are gamey; all
have the most charming of scenic surroundings, and, finally, all
are excellent as food, not in the first rank perhaps, but well
above the second. Notable among these are the European
charr (<i>Salvelinus alpinus</i>), the American speckled trout or charr
(<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>), the Dolly Varden or malma (<i>Salvelinus
malma</i>), and the oquassa trout (<i>Salvelinus oquassa</i>). Scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
less attractive are the true trout, the brown trout, or forelle
(<i>Salmo fario</i>), in Europe, the rainbow-trout (<i>Salmo irideus</i>),
the steelhead (<i>Salmo gairdneri</i>), the cut-throat trout (<i>Salmo
clarkii</i>), and the Tahoe trout (<i>Salmo henshawi</i>), in America,
and the yamabe (<i>Salmo perryi</i>) of Japan. Not least of all
these is the flower of fishes, the grayling (<i>Thymallus</i>), of different
species in different parts of the world.</p>

catfish (<i>Ictalurus punctatus</i>), the turbot (<i>Scophthalmus maximus</i>),
the barracuda (<i>Sphyr&aelig;na</i>), and the young of various sardines and
herring, known as whitebait. Of large fishes, probably the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
swordfish (<i>Xiphias gladius</i>), the halibut (<i>Hippoglossus hippoglossus</i>),
and the king-salmon, or quinnat (<i>Oncorhynchus tschawytscha</i>),
may be placed first. Those people who feed on raw fish
prefer in general the large parrot-fishes (as <i>Pseudoscarus jordani</i>
in Hawaii), or else the young of mullet and similar species.</p>

<p><b>Abundance of Food-fishes.</b>&mdash;In general, the economical value
of any species depends not on its toothsomeness, but on its
abundance and the ease with which it may be caught and preserved.
It is said that more individuals of the herring (<i>Clupea
harengus</i> in the Atlantic, <i>Clupea pallasi</i> in the Pacific) exist than
of any other species. The herring is a good food-fish and whenever
it runs it is freely sought. According to Bj&ouml;rns&ouml;n, wherever
the school of herring touches the coast of Norway, there a village
springs up, and this is true in Scotland, Newfoundland, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
from Killisnoo in Alaska to Otaru in Japan, and to Strielok in
Siberia. Goode estimates the herring product of the North
Atlantic at 1,500,000,000 pounds annually. In 1881 Professor
Huxley used these words:</p>

</div>

<p>"It is said that 2,500,000,000 or thereabout of herrings
are every year taken out of the North Sea and the Atlantic.
Suppose we assume the number to be 3,000,000,000 so as to be
quite safe. It is a large number undoubtedly, but what does
it come to? Not more than that of the herrings which may be
contained in one shoal, if it covers half a dozen square miles,
and shoals of much larger size are on record. It is safe to say
that scattered through the North Sea and the Atlantic, at one
and the same time, there must be scores of shoals, any one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
which would go a long way toward supplying the whole of man's
consumption of herrings."</p>

<p>The codfish (<i>Gadus callarias</i> in the Atlantic; <i>Gadus macrocephalus</i>
in the Pacific) likewise swarms in all the northern seas,
takes the hook readily, and is better food when salted and dried
than it is when fresh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>Next in economic importance probably stands the mackerel
of the Atlantic (<i>Scomber scombrus</i>), a rich, oily fish which bears
salting better than most.</p>

<p>Not less important is the great king-salmon, or quinnat (<i>Oncorhyanchus

salmon, or redfish (<i>Oncorhynchus nerka</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>The salmon of the Atlantic (<i>Salmo salar</i>), the various species
of sturgeon (<i>Acipenser</i>), the sardines (<i>Sardinella</i>), the halibut
(<i>Hippoglossus</i>), are also food-fishes of great importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Variety of Tropical Fishes.</b>&mdash;In the tropics no one species is
represented by enormous numbers of individuals as is the case
in colder regions. On the other hand, the number of species
regarded as food-fishes is much greater in any given port. In
Havana, about 350 different species are sold as food in the markets,
and an equal number are found in Honolulu. Upward of
600 different species appear in the markets of Japan. In England,
on the contrary, about 50 species make up the list of fishes
commonly used as food. Yet the number of individual fishes
is probably not greater about Japan or Hawaii than in a similar
stretch of British coast.</p>

<p><b>Economic Fisheries.</b>&mdash;Volumes have been written on the economic
value of the different species of fishes, and it is not the
purpose of the present work to summarize their contents.</p>

</div>

<p>Equally voluminous is the literature on the subject of catching
fishes. It ranges in quality from the quaint wisdom of the
"Compleat Angler" and the delicate wit of "Little Rivers" to
elaborate discussions of the most economic and effective forms
and methods, of the beam-trawl, the purse-seine, and the cod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>fish
hook. In general, fishes are caught in four ways&mdash;by baited
hooks, by spears, by traps, and by nets. Special local methods,
such as the use of the tamed cormorant<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> in the catching of the
ayu, by the Japanese fishermen at Gifu, may be set aside for
the moment, and all general methods of fishing come under
one of these four classes. Of these methods, the hook, the
spear, the seine, the beam-trawl, the gill-net, the purse-net, the
sweep-net, the trap and the weir are the most important. The
use of the hook is again extremely varied. In the deep sea
long, sunken lines, are sometimes used for codfish, each baited
with many hooks. For pelagic fish, a baited hook is drawn
swiftly over the surface, with a "spoon" attached which
looks like a living fish. In the rivers a line is attached to
a pole, and when fish are caught for pleasure or for the joy of
being in the woods, recreation rises to the dignity of angling.
Angling may be accomplished with a hook baited with an earthworm,
a grasshopper, a living fish, or the larva of some insect.
The angler of to-day, however, prefers the artificial fly, as being
more workmanlike and also more effective than bait-fishing.
The man who fishes, not for the good company of the woods
and brooks, but to get as many fish as possible to eat or sell, is
not an angler but a pot-fisher. The man who kills all the trout
he can, to boast of his skill or fortune, is technically known as
a trout-hog. Ethically, it is better to lie about your great
catches of fine fishes than to make them. For most anglers,
also, it is more easy.</p>

<p><b>Fisheries.</b>&mdash;With the multiplicity of apparatus for fishing,
there is the greatest variety in the boats which may be used.
The fishing-fleet of any port of the world is a most interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>object, as are also the fishermen with their quaint garb, plain
speech, and their strange songs and calls with the hauling in of
the net.</p>

</div>

<p>For much information on the fishing apparatus in use in
America the reader is referred to the Reports of the Fisheries in
the Tenth Census, in 1880, under the editorship of Dr. George
Brown Goode. In these reports Goode, Stearns, Earle, Gilbert,
Bean, and the present writer have treated very fully of all economic
relations of the American fishes. In an admirable work
entitled "American Fishes," Dr. Goode, with the fine literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
touch of which he was master, has fully discoursed of the game- and
food-fishes of America with especial reference to the habits
and methods of capture of each. To these sources, to Jordan
and Evermann's "Food and Game Fishes of North America,"
and to many other works of similar purport in other lands, the
reader is referred for an account of the economic and the
human side of fish and fisheries.</p>

<p><b>Angling.</b>&mdash;It is no part of the purpose of this work to describe
the methods or materials of angling, still less to sing its
praises as a means of physical or moral regeneration. We may
perhaps find room for a first and a last word on the subject; the
one the classic from the pen of the angler of the brooks of Staffordshire,
and the other the fresh expression of a Stanford student
setting out for streams such as Walton never knew, the
Purissima, the Stanislaus, or perchance his home streams, the
Provo or the Bear.</p>

<p>"And let me tell you, this kind of fishing with a dead rod,
and laying night-hooks, are like putting money to use; for they
both work for the owners when they do nothing but sleep, or
eat, or rejoice, as you know we have done this last hour, and
sat as quietly and as free from cares under this sycamore as
Virgil's Tityrus and his Melib&oelig;us did under their broad beech-tree.
No life, my honest scholar,&mdash;no life so happy and so
pleasant as the life of a well-governed angler; for when the
lawyer is swallowed up with business and the statesman is preventing
or contriving plots, then we sit on the cowslip-banks,
hear the birds sing, and possess ourselves in as much quietness
as these silent silver streams which we now see glide so quietly
by us. Indeed, my good scholar, we may say of angling, as
Dr. Boteler said of strawberries, 'Doubtless God could have made
a better berry, but doubtless God never did'; and so, if I might
be judge, 'God never made a more calm, quiet, innocent recreation
than angling.'</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, scholar, when I sat last on this primrose-bank,
and looked down these meadows, I thought of them as Charles
the Emperor did of Florence, 'That they were too pleasant to
be looked on but only on holidays.'</p>

<p>"Gentle Izaak! He has been dead these many years, but
his disciples are still faithful. When the cares of business lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
heavy and the sound of wheels jarring on cobbled streets grows
painful, one's fingers itch for the rod; one would away to the
quiet brook among the pines, where one has fished so often.
Every man who has ever got the love of the stream in his blood
feels often this longing.</p>

<p>"It comes to me each year with the first breath of spring.
There is something in the sweetness of the air, the growing
things, the 'robin in the greening grass' that voices it. Duties
that have before held in their performance something of pleasure
become irksome, and practical thoughts of the day's work
are replaced by dreamy pictures of a tent by the side of a mountain
stream&mdash;close enough to hear the water's singing in the
night. Two light bamboo rods rest against the tent-pole, and
a little column of smoke rising straight up through the branches
marks the supper fire. Jack is preparing the evening meal,
and, as I dream, there comes to me the odor of crisply browned
trout and sputtering bacon&mdash;was ever odor more delicious?
I dare say that had the good Charles Lamb smelled it as I have,
his 'Dissertation on Roast Pig' would never have been written.
But then Charles Lamb never went a-fishing as we do here in
the west&mdash;we who have the mountains and the fresh air so
boundlessly.</p>

<p>"And neither did Izaak Walton for that matter. He who is
sponsor for all that is gentle in angling missed much that is
best in the sport by living too early. He did not experience
the exquisite pleasure of wading down mountain streams in
supposedly water-proof boots and feeling the water trickling in
coolingly; nor did he know the joy of casting a gaudy fly far
ahead with a four-ounce rod, letting it drift, insect-like, over
that black hole by the tree stump, and then feeling the seaweed
line slip through his fingers to the <i>whirr</i> of the reel. And,
at the end of the day, supper over, he did not squat around a
big camp-fire and light his pipe, the silent darkness of the mountains
gathering round, and a basketful of willow-packed trout
hung in the clump of pines by the tent. Izaak's idea of fishing
did not comprehend such joy. With a can of worms and a
crude hook, he passed the day by quiet streams, threading the
worms on his hook and thinking kindly of all things. The
day's meditations over, he went back to the village, and, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>hap,
joined a few kindred souls over a tankard of ale at the
sign of the Red Lobster. But he missed the mountains, the
water rushing past his tent, the bacon and trout, the camp-fire&mdash;the
physical exaltation of it all. His kind of fishing was
angling purely, while modern Waltons, as a rule, eschew the
worm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>"To my mind, there is no real sport in any kind of fishing
except fly-fishing. This sitting on the bank of a muddy stream
with your bait sunk, waiting for a bite, may be conducive to
gentleness and patience of spirit, but it has not the joy of action
in which a healthy man revels. How much more sport is it to
clamber over fallen logs that stretch far out a-stream, to wade
slipping over boulders and let your fly drop caressingly on
ripples and swirling eddies and still holes! It is worth all the
work to see the gleam of a silver side as a half-pounder rises,
and, with a flop, takes the fly excitedly to the bottom. And
then the nervous thrill as, with a deft turn of the wrist, you
hook him securely&mdash;whoever has felt that thrill cannot forget
it. It will come back to him in his law office when he should
be thinking of other things; and with it will come a longing
for that dear remembered stream and the old days. That is
the hold trout-fishing takes on a man.</p>

<p>"It is spring now and I feel the old longing myself, as I
always do when life comes into the air and the smell of new
growth is sweet. I got my rod out to-day, put it together,
and have been looking over my flies. If I cannot use them, I
can at least muse over days of the past and dream of those to
come." (<span class="smcap">Waldemar Young.</span>)</p>

its wings and a ring about the lower part of its neck. Two or three birds
may be driven by a boy in a shallow stream, a small net behind him to drive
the fish down the river. In a large river like that of Gifu, where the cormorants
are most used, the fishermen hold the birds from the boats and fish
after dark by torchlight. The bird takes a great interest in the work, darts
at the fishes with great eagerness, and fills its throat and gular pouch as
far down as the ring. Then the boy takes him out of the water, holds him
by the leg and shakes the fishes out into a basket. When the fishing is over
the ayu are preserved, the ring is taken off from the bird's neck, and the zako
or minnows are thrown to him for his share. These he devours greedily.</p></div></div>

DISEASES OF FISHES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_340.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Contagious</span> Diseases.</b>&mdash;As compared with other animals
the fishes of the sea are subject to but few
specific diseases. Those in fresh waters, being
more isolated, are more frequently attacked by contagious
maladies. Often these diseases are very destructive. In an
"epidemic" in Lake Mendota, near Madison, Wis., Professor
Stephen A. Forbes reports a death of 300 tons of fishes in the
lake. I have seen similar conditions among the land-locked
alewife in Cayuga and Seneca Lakes, the dead fishes being
piled on the beaches so as to fill the air with the stench of their
decay.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Crustacean Parasites.</b>&mdash;The external parasites of fishes are of
little injury. These are mainly lern&aelig;ans and other crustaceans
(fish-lice) in the sea, and in the rivers different species of
leeches. These may suck the blood of the fish, or in the case
of certain crustaceans which lie under the tongue, steal the food
as it passes along, as is done by <i>Cymothoa pr&aelig;gustator</i>, the
"bug" of the mouth of the menhaden (<i>Brevoortia tyrannus</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
The relation of this crustacean to its host suggested to Latrobe,
its discoverer, the relation of the "foretaster" in Roman times
to the tyrant whom he served. A similar commensation exists
in the mouth of a mullet (<i>Mugil hospes</i>) at Panama. The
writer has received, through the courtesy of Mr. A. P. Lundin, a
specimen of a flying-fish (<i>Exonautes unicolor</i>) taken off Sydney,
Australia. To this are attached three large copepod crustaceans
of the genus <i>Penella</i>, the largest over two inches long, and to
the copepods in turn are attached a number of barnacles (<i>Conchoderma
virgatum</i>) so joined to the copepods as to suggest
strange flowers, like orchids, growing out of the fish.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Myxosporidia, or Parasitic Protozoa.</b>&mdash;Internal parasites are
very numerous and varied. Some of them are bacteria, giving
rise to infectious diseases, especially in ponds and lakes. Others
are myxosporidia, or parasitic protozoans, which form warty appendages,
which burst, discharging the germs and leaving ulcers
in their place. In the report of the U. S. Fish Commissioner
for 1892, Dr. R. R. Gurley has brought together our knowledge
of the protozoans of the subclass <i>Myxosporidia</i>, to which
these epidemics are chiefly due. These creatures belong to the
class of Sporozoa, and are regarded as animals, their nearest
relatives being the parasitic <i>Gregarinida</i>, from which they differ
in having the germinal portion of the spore consisting of a
single protoplasmic mass instead of falciform protoplasmic
rods as in the worm-like Gregarines. The <i>Myxosporidia</i>
are parasitic on fishes, both fresh-water and marine, especially
beneath the epidermis of the gills and fins and in the gall-bladder
and urinary bladder. In color these protozoa are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
always cream-white. In size and form they vary greatly.
The cyst in which they lie is filled with creamy substance
made up of spores and granule matter.</p>

<p>Dr. Gurley enumerates as hosts of these parasites about
sixty species of fishes, marine and fresh-water, besides frogs,
crustaceans, sea-worms, and even the crocodile. In the sharks
and rays the parasites occur mainly in the gall-ducts, in the
minnows within the gill cavity and epidermis, and in the higher
fishes mainly but not exclusively in the same regions. Forty-seven
species are regarded by Gurley as well defined. The
diseases produced by them are very obscurely known. These
parasites on American fishes have been extensively studied by
Charles Wardall Stiles, Edwin Linton, Henry B. Ward, and
others.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Linton the parasitism which results from
infection with protozoan parasites will, of all kinds, be found to
be the most important. Epidemics among European fish have
been repeatedly traced to this source. The fatality which
attends infection with psorosperms appears to be due to a secondary
cause, however, namely, to bacilli which develop within
the psorosperms (<i>Myxobolus</i>) tumors and give rise to ulceration.
The discharge of these ulcers then disseminates the disease.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 228.</span>&mdash;White Shiner, <i>Notropis hudsonius</i> (Clinton), with cysts of parasitic
psorosperms. (After Gurley.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Brief mention of the remedies there proposed may appropriately
be repeated here. Megnin sees no other method than
to collect all the dead and sick fishes and to destroy them by
fire. Ludwig thinks that the waters should be kept pure, and
that the pollutions of the rivers by communities or industrial
establishments should be interdicted. Further he says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>"That most dangerous contamination of the water by the
<i>Myxosporidia</i> from the ulcers cannot of course be stopped entirely,
but it is evident that it will be less if all fishermen are
impressed with the importance of destroying all diseased and
dead fish instead of throwing them back into the water. Such
destruction must be so effected as to prevent the re-entry of
the germs into the water.</p>

<p>"Railliet says that it is expedient to collect the diseased
fish and to bury them at a certain depth and at a great distance
from the water-course. He further states that this was done
on the Meuse with success, so that at the end of some years the
disease appeared to have left no trace."</p>

</div>

<p><b>Parasitic Worms: Trematodes.</b>&mdash;Parasitic worms in great
variety exist in the intestinal canal or in the liver or muscular
substance of fishes.</p>

<p>Trematode worms are most common in fresh-water fishes.
These usually are sources of little injury, especially when found
in the intestines, but they may do considerable mischief when
encysted within the body cavity or in the heart or liver. Dr.
Linton describes 31 species of these worms from 25 different
species of American fishes. In 20 species of fishes from the
Great Lakes, 102 specimens, Dr. H. B. Ward found 95 specimens
infected with parasites, securing 4000 trematodes, 2000
acanchocephala, 200 cestodes, and 200 nematodes. In the
bowfin (<i>Amia calva</i>), trematodes existed in enormous numbers.</p>

<p><b>Cestodes.</b>&mdash;Cestode worms exist largely in marine fishes,
the adults, according to Dr. Linton, being especially common
in the spiral valve of the shark. It is said that one species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
human tape-worm (<i>Bothriocephalus t&aelig;nia</i>) has been got from
eating the flesh of the European tench (<i>Tinca tinca</i>).</p>

<p><b>The Worm of the Yellowstone.</b>&mdash;The most remarkable case
of parasitism of worms of this type is that given by the trout
of Yellowstone Lake (<i>Salmo clarki</i>). This is thus described by
Dr. Linton:</p>

<p>"One of the most interesting cases of parasitism in which
direct injury results to the host, which has come to my attention,
is that afforded by the trout of Yellowstone Lake (<i>Salmo
clarki</i>). It was noticed by successive parties who visited the
lake in connection with government surveys that the trout
with which the lake abounded were, to a large extent, infested
with a parasitic worm, which is most commonly in the abdominal
cavity, in cysts, but which in time escapes from the cyst
and tunnels into the flesh of its host. Fish, when thus much
afflicted, are found to be lacking in vitality, weak, and often
positively emaciated.</p>

<p>"It was my good fortune, in the summer of 1890, to visit
this interesting region for the purpose of investigating the parasitism
of the trout of Yellowstone Lake. The results of this
special investigation were published in the Bulletin of the
U. S. Fish Commission for 1889, vol. ix., pp. 337-358, under the
title 'A Contribution to the Life-history of <i>Dibothrium cordiceps</i>,
a Parasite Infesting the Trout of Yellowstone Lake.'</p>

<p>"I found the same parasite in the trout of Heart Lake, just
across the great continental divide from Yellowstone Lake, but
did not find any that had tunneled into the flesh of its host,
while a considerable proportion of the trout taken in Yellowstone
Lake had these worms in the flesh. Some of these worms
were as much as 30 centimeters in length when first removed;
others which had lain in water a few hours after removal before
they were measured were much longer, as much as 54 centimeters.
They are rather slender and of nearly uniform size
throughout, 2.5 to 3 millimeters being an average breadth of
the largest. I found the adult stage in the intestine of the
large white pelican (<i>Pelecanus erythrorhynchus</i>), which is abundant
on the lake and was found breeding on some small islands
near the southern end of the lake.</p>

<p>"In the paper alluded to above I attempted to account for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
two things concerning this parasitism among the trout of Yellowstone
Lake: First, the abundance of parasitized trout in
the lake; second, the migration of the parasite into the muscular
tissue of its host. The argument cannot be well summarized
in as short space as the requirements of this paper
demand. It is sufficient to say that what appear to me to be
satisfactory explanations are supplied by the peculiar conditions
of distribution of fish in the lakes of this national park.
Until three or four years ago, when the U. S. Fish Commission
stocked some of the lakes and streams of the park, the conditions
with relation to fish life in the three principal lakes were
as follows: Shoshone Lake, no fish of any kind; Heart Lake,
at least three species, <i>Salmo clarki</i>, <i>Leuciscus lineatus</i>, and
<i>Catostomus ardens</i>; Yellowstone Lake, one species, <i>Salmo clarki</i>.
Shoshone and Yellowstone Lakes are separated from the river
systems which drain them by falls too high for fish to scale.
Heart Lake has no such barrier. The trout of Yellowstone
Lake are confined to the lake and to eighteen miles of river
above the falls. Whatever source of parasitism exists in the
lake, therefore, must continue to affect the fish all their lives.
They cannot be going and coming from the lake as the trout
of Heart Lake may freely do. If their food should contain
eggs of parasites, or if the waters in which they swim should
contain eggs or embryos of parasites, they would be continually
exposed to infection, with no chance for a vacation trip for
recuperation. To quote from my report:</p>

<p>"'It follows, therefore, from the peculiar conditions surrounding
the trout of Yellowstone Lake, that if there is a cause
of parasitism present in successive years the trout are more
liable to become infested than they would be in waters where
they had a more varied range. Trout would become infested
earlier and in greater relative numbers, and the life of the parasites
themselves&mdash;that is, their residence as encysted worms&mdash;must
be of longer duration than would be the rule where
the natural conditions are less exceptional.... There are
probably not less than one thousand pelicans on the lake the
greater part of the time throughout the summer, of which at
any time not less than 50 per cent. are infested with the adult
form of the parasite, and, since they spend the greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
their time on or over the water, disseminate millions of tape-worm
eggs each in the waters of the lake. It is known that
eggs of other dibothria hatch out in the water, where they swim
about for some time, looking much like ciliated infusoria. Donnadieu
found in his experiments on the adult dibothria of ducks
that the eggs hatched out readily in warm water and very
slowly in cold. If warm water, at least water that is warmer
than the prevailing temperature of the lake, is needed for the
proper development of these ova, the conditions are supplied in
such places as the shore system of geysers and hot springs on
the west arm of the lake, where for a distance of nearly three
miles the shore is skirted by a hot spring and geyser formation,
with numerous streams of hot water emptying into the lake,
and large springs of hot water opening in the floor of the lake
near shore.</p>

<p>"'Trout abound in the vicinity of these warm springs, presumably
on account of the abundance of food there. They do
not love the warm water, but usually avoid it. Several persons
with whom I talked on the subject while in the park assert that
diseased fish&mdash;that is to say, those which are thin and affected
with flesh worms&mdash;are more commonly found near the warm
water; that they take the bait readily but are logy. I frequently
saw pelicans swimming near the shore in the vicinity of
the warm springs on the west arm of the lake. It would appear
that the badly infested or diseased fish, being less active and
gamy than the healthy fish, would be more easily taken by
their natural enemies, who would learn to look for them in
places where they most abound. But any circumstances which
cause the pelican and the trout to occupy the same neighborhood
will multiply the chances of the parasites developing in
both the intermediate and final host. The causes that make
for the abundance of the trout parasite conspire to increase the
number of adults. The two hosts react on each other and the
parasite profits by the reaction. About the only enemies the
trout had before tourists, ambitious to catch big strings of
trout and photograph them with a kodak, began to frequent
this region, were the fish-eating birds, and chief among these in
numbers and voracity was the pelican. It is no wonder, therefore,
that the trout should have become seriously parasitized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
It may be inferred from the foregoing statements that the reason
why the parasite of the trout of Yellowstone Lake migrates
into the muscular tissue of its host must be found in the fact
that the life of the parasite within the fish is much more prolonged
than is the case where the conditions of life are less
exceptional.</p>

<p>"The case just cited is probably the most signal one of
direct injury to the host from the presence of parasites that
I have seen. I shall enumerate more briefly a few additional
cases out of a great number that I have encountered in my
special investigations on the entozoa of fishes for the U. S. Fish
Commission."</p>

<p>Many worms of this type abound in codfishes, bluefishes,
striped bass, and other marine fishes, rendering them lean and
unfit for food.</p>

<p><b>The Heart Lake Tape-worm.</b>&mdash;Another very interesting case
of parasitism is that of the large tape-worm (<i>Ligula catostomi</i>)
infecting the suckers, <i>Catostomus ardens</i>, in the warm waters
of Witch Creek, near Heart Lake, in the Yellowstone Park. Of
this Dr. Linton gives the following account:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_348.jpg" width="700" height="271" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 230.</span>&mdash;Sucker, <i>Catostomus ardens</i> (Jordan &amp; Gilbert), from Heart Lake, Yellowstone
Park, infested by a flatworm, <i>Ligula catostomi</i> Linton, itself probably a
larva of <i>Dibothrium</i>. (After Linton.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>"In the autumn of 1889 Dr. David Starr Jordan found an
interesting case of parasitism in some young suckers (<i>Catostomus
ardens</i>) which he had collected in Witch Creek, a small
stream which flows into Heart Lake, in the Yellowstone National
Park. Specimens of these parasites were sent to me for identification.
They proved to be a species of ligula, probably identical
with the European <i>Ligula simplicissima</i> Rud., which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
found in the abdominal cavity of the tench. On account of
its larval condition in which it possesses few distinctive characters,
I described it under the name <i>Ligula catostomi</i>. These
parasites grow to a very large size when compared with the
fish which harbors them, often filling the abdominal cavity to
such a degree as to give the fish a deceptively plump appearance.
The largest specimen in Dr. Jordan's collection measured,
in alcohol, 28.5 centimeters in length, 8 millimeters in
breadth at the anterior end, 11 millimeters at a distance of
7 millimeters from the anterior end, and 1.5 millimeters near
the posterior end. The thickness throughout was about 2 millimeters.
The weight of one fish was 9.1 grams, that of its
three parasites 2.5 grams, or 27&frac12; per cent. the weight of the
host. If a man weighing 180 pounds were afflicted with tape-worms
to a similar degree, he would be carrying about with
him 50 pounds of parasitic impedimenta.</p>

<p>"In the summer of 1890 I collected specimens from the
same locality. A specimen obtained from a fish 19 centimeters
in length measured while living 39.5 centimeters in length
and 15 millimeters in breadth at the anterior end. Another
fish 15 centimeters in length harbored four parasites, 12, 13,
13, and 20 centimeters long, respectively, or 58 centimeters
aggregate. Another fish 10 centimeters long was infested
with a single parasite which was 39 centimeters in length.</p>

<p>"These parasites were found invariably free in the body
cavity. Dr. Jordan's collections were made in October and
mine in July of the following year. Donnadieu has found that
this parasite most frequently attains its maximum development
at the end of two years. It is probable, therefore, that
Dr. Jordan and I collected from the same generation. Since
these parasites, in this stage of their existence, develop, not by
levying a toll on the food of their host, after the manner of
intestinal parasites, but directly by the absorption of the serous
fluid of their host, it is quite evident that they work a positive
and direct injury. Since, however, they lie quietly in the body
cavity of the fish and possess no hard parts to cause irritation,
they work their mischief simply by the passive abstraction of
the nutritive juices of their host, and by crowding the viscera
into confined spaces and unnatural positions. The worms, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
almost every case, had attained such a size that they far exceeded
in bulk the entire viscera of their host.</p>

<p>"From the fact that the examples obtained were of comparatively
the same age, it may be justly inferred that the period
of infection to which the fish are subjected must be a short one.
I did not discover the final host, but it is almost certain to be
one or more of the fish-eating species of birds which visit that
region, and presumably one of which, in its migrations, pays
but a brief visit to this particular locality. This parasite was
found only in the young suckers which inhabit a warm tributary
of Witch Creek. They were not found in the large suckers of the
lake. These young <i>Catostomi</i> were found in a single school,
associated with the young of the chub (<i>Leuciscus lineatus</i>),
in a stream whose temperature was 95&deg; F. near where it
joined a cold mountain brook whose temperature was 46&deg; F.
We seined several hundred of these young suckers and chubs,
ranging in length from 6 to 19 centimeters. The larger suckers
were nearly all infested with these parasites, the smaller ones
not so much, and the smallest scarcely at all. Or, to give concrete
examples: Of 30 fish ranging in length from 14 to 19 centimeters,
only one or two were without parasites; of 45 specimens
averaging about 10 centimeters in length, 15 were infested
and 30 were not; of 65 specimens averaging about 9 centimeters
in length, 10 were infested and 55 were not; of 62 specimens
less than 9 centimeters in length, 2 were infested and 60 were
not. None of the chubs were infested with this parasite.</p>

<p>"The conditions under which these fish were found are
worthy of passing notice. The stream which they occupied
flowed with rather sluggish current into a swift mountain
stream, which it met almost at right angles. The school of
young chubs and suckers showed no inclination to enter the
cold water, even to escape the seine, but would dart around
the edge of the seine, in the narrow space between it and the
bank, in preference, apparently, to taking to the colder water.
When not disturbed by the seine they would swim up near to
the line which marked the division between the cold and the
warm water, and seemed to be gazing with open mouth and
eyes at the trout which occasionally darted past in the cold
stream. The trout appeared to avoid the warm water, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
the chubs and suckers appeared to avoid the cold water. It
may be that what the latter really avoided was the special
preserve of the trout, since large chubs and suckers are found
in abundance in the lake, which is quite cold, a temperature of
40&deg; F. having been taken by us at a depth of 124 feet.</p>

<p>"Since the eggs of this parasite, after the analogy of closely
related forms, in all probability are discharged into the water
from the final host and hatch out readily in warm water, where
they may live for a longer or shorter time as free-swimming
planula-like forms, it will be observed that the sluggish current
and high temperature of the water in which these parasitized
fish occur give rise to conditions which are highly favorable to
infection.</p>

<p>"It may be of passing interest to state here what I have
recorded elsewhere, that ligul&aelig;, probably specifically identical
with <i>L. catostomi</i>, form an article of food in Italy, where they
are sold in the markets under the name <i>maccaroni piatti</i>; also
in southern France, where they are less euphemistically but
more truthfully called the <i>ver blanc</i>. So far as my information
goes, this diet of worms is strictly European.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary to prove cases of direct injury resulting
from the presence of parasites in order to make out a case
against them. In the sharp competition which nature forces
on fishes in the ordinary struggle for existence, any factor
which imparts an increment either of strength or of weakness
may be a very potent one, and in a long term of years may
determine the relative abundance or rarity of the individuals
of a species. In most cases the interrelations between parasite
and host have become so adjusted that the evil wrought by the
parasite on its host is small. Parasitic forms, like free forms,
are simply developing along the lines of their being, but unlike
most free forms they do not contribute a fair share to the food
of other creatures."</p>

<p><b>Thorn-head Worms.</b>&mdash;The thorn-head worms called <i>Acanthocephala</i>
are found occasionally in large numbers in different
kinds of fishes. They penetrate the coats of the intestines,
producing much irritation and finally waxy degeneration of
the tissues.</p>

<p>According to Linton, there is probably no practical way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
counteracting the bad influences of worms of this order, since
their larval state is passed, in some cases certainly, and in most
cases probably, in small crustacea, which constitute a constant
and necessary source of food for the fish. The same remark
which was made in another connection with regard to the disposal
of the viscera of fish applies here. In no case should the
viscera of fish be thrown back into the water. In this order
the sexes are distinct, and the females become at last veritable
sacs for the shelter and nourishment of enormous numbers of
embryos. The importance, therefore, of arresting the development
of as many embryos as possible is at once apparent.</p>

<p><b>Nematodes.</b>&mdash;The round worms or nematodes are very
especially abundant in marine fishes, and particularly in the
young. The study of these forms has a large importance to
man. Dr. Linton pertinently observes:</p>

<p>"Where there is exhaustive knowledge of the thing itself
the application of that knowledge toward getting good out of
it or averting evil that may come from it first becomes possible.
For example, a knowledge of the life-history of <i>Trichina spiralis</i>
and its pathological effects on its host has taught people a simple
way of securing immunity from its often deadly effects. A
knowledge of the life-histories of the various species of t&aelig;ni&aelig;
which infest man and the domestic animals, frequently to their
serious hurt, has made it possible to diminish their numbers,
and may, in time, lead to their practical extinction.</p>

<p>"So with the parasites of fishes. Whenever for any reason
or reasons parasitism of any sort becomes so prevalent with any
species as to amount to a disease, the remedy will be suggested,
and in some cases may be practically applied. If, for example,
it were thought desirable to counteract the influences which are
at work to cause the parasitism of the trout of Yellowstone
Lake, it could be very largely accomplished by breaking up
the breeding-places of the pelican on the islands of the lake.
With regard to parasitism among the marine food-fishes, the
remedy while plainly suggested by the circumstances, might be
difficult of application. Yet something could be done even
there, if it were thought necessary to lessen the amount of
parasitism. If such precautions as the destruction of the parasites
which abound in the viscera of fish before throwing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
back into the water, and if no opportunity be lost of killing
those sharks which feed on the food-fishes, two sources of the
prevalence of parasites would be affected and the sum total of
parasitism diminished. These remarks are made not so much
because such precautions are needed as to suggest possible
applications of knowledge which is already available."</p>

<p><b>Parasitic Fungi.</b>&mdash;Fishes are often subject to wounds. If
not too serious these will heal in time, with or without scars.
Some lost portions may be restored, but not those including
bone fin-rays or scales. In the fresh waters, wounds are usually
attacked by species of fungus, notably <i>Saprolegnia ferox</i>,
<i>Saprolegnia mixta</i>, and others, which makes a whitish fringe
over a sore and usually causes death. This fungus is especially
destructive in aquaria. This fungus is not primarily parasitic,
but it fixes itself in the slime of a fish or in an injured place, and
once established the animal is at its mercy. Spent salmon are
very often attacked by this fungus. In America the spent salmon
always dies, but in Scotland, where such is not the case,
much study has been given to this plant and the means by
which it may be exterminated. Dr. G. P. Clinton gives a
useful account of the development of <i>Saprolegnia</i>, from which
we take the following:</p>

<p>"The minute structure and life-history of such fungous
forms have been so thoroughly made out by eminent specialists
that no investigation along this line was made, save to observe
those phenomena which might be easily seen with ordinary
microscopic manipulations. The fungus consists of branched,
hyaline filaments, without septa, except as these are found
cutting off the reproductive parts of the threads. It is made
up of a root-like or rhizoid part that penetrates the fish and a
vegetative and reproductive part that radiates from the host.
The former consists of branched tapering threads which pierce
the tissues for a short distance, but are easily pulled out. The
function of this part is to obtain nourishment for the growth
of the external parts. Prostrate threads are found running
through the natural slime covering the fish, and from these are
produced the erect radiating hyph&aelig; so plainly seen when in
the water. The development of these threads appears to be
very rapid when viewed under the microscope, although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
growth made under favorable conditions in two days is only
about a third of an inch. From actual measurements of filaments
of the fungus placed in water and watched under the
microscope, it was found that certain threads made a growth
of about 3000 microns in an hour. Two others, watched for
twenty minutes, gave in that time a growth of 90 and 47 microns
respectively; and yet another filament, observed during two
periods of five minutes each, made a growth of 28 microns each
time. In ordinary cultures the rate of growth depends upon
the condition of the medium, host, etc."</p>

</div>

<p>Professor H. A. Surface thus speaks of the attacks of <i>Saprolegnia</i>
on the lamprey:</p>

<p>"The attack that attends the end of more lampreys than
does any other is that of the fungus (<i>Saprolegnia</i> sp.). This
looks like a gray slime and eats into the exterior parts of the
animal, finally causing death. It covers the skin, the fins, the
eyes, the gill-pouches, and all parts, like leprosy. It starts
where the lamprey has been scratched or injured or where its
mate has held it, and develops very rapidly when the water is
warm. It is found late in the season on all lampreys that have
spawned out, and it is almost sure to prove fatal, as we have
repeatedly seen with attacked fishes or lampreys kept in tanks
or aquaria. With choice aquarium fishes a remedy, or at least
a palliative, is to be found in immersion in salt water for a few
minutes or in bathing the affected parts with listerine. Since
these creatures complete the spawning process before the fungoid
attack proves serious to the individual, it can be seen that
it affects no injury to the race, as the fertilized eggs are left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
come to maturity. Also, as it is nature's plan that the adult
lampreys die after spawning once, we are convinced that death
would ensue without the attack of the fungus; and in fact this
is to be regarded as a resultant of those causes that produce
death rather than the immediate cause of it. Its only natural
remedy is to be found in the depths of the lake (450 feet) where
there is a uniform or constant temperature of about 39&deg; Fahr.,
and where the light of the noon-day sun penetrates with an
intensity only about equal to starlight on land on a clear but
moonless night.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>"As light and heat are essential to the development of the
fungus, which is a plant growth and properly called a water
mold, and as their intensity is so greatly diminished in the
depth of the lake, it is probable that if creatures thus attacked
should reach this depth they might here find relief if their
physical condition were otherwise strong enough to recuperate.
However, we have recently observed a distinct tendency on
the part of fungus-covered fishes to keep in the shallower, and
consequently warmer, parts of the water, and this of course
results in the more rapid growth of the sarcophytic plant, and
the death of the fishes is thus hastened.</p>

<p>"All kinds of fishes and fish-eggs are subject to the attacks
of such fungus, especially after having been even slightly
scratched or injured. As a consequence, the lamprey attacks
on fishes cause wounds that often become the seat of a slowly
spreading but fatal fungus. We have seen many nests of the
bullhead, or horned pout (<i>Ameiurus nebulosus</i>), with all the
eggs thus destroyed, and we have found scores of fishes of various
kinds thus killed or dying. It is well known that in many
rivers this is the apparent cause of great mortality among adult
salmon. Yet we really doubt if it ever attacks uninjured fishes
that are in good strong physical condition which have not at
least had the slime rubbed from them when captured. It is
contagious, not only being conveyed from one infested fish to
another, but from dead flies to fishes." (For a further discussion
of this subject see an interesting and valuable Manual of
Fish Culture, by the U. S. Fish Commission, 1897.)</p>

<p><b>Earthquakes.</b>&mdash;Occasionally an earthquake has been known
to kill sea-fishes in large numbers. The <i>Albatross</i> obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
specimens of <i>Sternoptyx diaphana</i> in the Japanese Kuro Shiwo,
killed by the earthquakes of 1896, which destroyed fishing
villages of the coast of Rikuchu in northern Japan.</p>

<p><b>Mortality of Tilefish.</b>&mdash;Some years ago in the Gulf Stream
off Newfoundland an immense mortality of the filefish (<i>Lopholatilus
cham&aelig;leonticeps</i>) was reported by fishermen. This handsome
and large fish, inhabiting deep waters, died by thousands.
For this mortality, which almost exterminated the species, no
adequate cause has been found.</p>

<p>As to the destruction of fresh-water fishes by larger enemies,
we may quote from Professor H. A. Surface. He says
there is no doubt that these three species, the lake lamprey
(<i>Petromyzon marinus unicolor</i>), the garpike (<i>Lepidosteus osseus</i>),
and the mud-puppy (<i>Necturus maculosus</i>), named "in order
of destructiveness, are the three most serious enemies of fishes
in the interior of this State [New York], each of which surely
destroys more fishes annually than are caught by all the fishermen
combined. The next important enemies of fishes in
order of destructiveness, according to our observations and
belief, are spawn-eating fishes, water-snakes, carnivorous or
predaceous aquatic insects (especially larv&aelig;), and piscivorous
fishes and birds." The lamprey attaches itself to larger fishes,
rasping away their flesh and sucking their blood, as shown in
the accompanying plate.</p>

THE MYTHOLOGY OF FISHES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_359.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Mermaid.</b>&mdash;A word may be said of the fishes
which have no existence in fact and yet appear in
popular literature or in superstition.</p>

<p>The mermaid, half woman and half fish, has been one
of the most tenacious among these, and the manufacture of
their dried bodies from the head, shoulders, and ribs of a
monkey sealed to the body of a fish has long been a profitable
industry in the Orient. The sea-lion, the dugong, and other
marine mammals have been mistaken for mermaids, for their
faces seen at a distance and their movements at rest are not
inhuman, and their limbs and movements in the water are
fish-like.</p>

<p>In China, small mermaids are very often made and sold to
the curious. The head and torso of a monkey are fastened
ingeniously to the body and tail of a fish. It is said that Linn&aelig;us
was once forced to leave a town in Holland for questioning
the genuineness of one of these mermaids, the property of
some high official. These monsters are still manufactured for
the "curio-trade."</p>

<p><b>The Monkfish.</b>&mdash;Many strange fishes were described in the
Middle Ages, the interest usually centering in some supposed
relation of their appearance with the affairs of men. Some of
these find their way into Rondelet's excellent book, "Histoire
Enti&egrave;re des Poissons," in 1558. Two of these with the accompanying
plate of one we here reproduce. Other myths less
interesting grew out of careless, misprinted, or confused accounts
on the part of naturalists and travelers.</p>

<p>"In our times in Norway a sea-monster has been taken after

monk; for it had a man's face, rude and ungracious, the head
shorn and smooth. On the shoulders, like the cloak of a monk,
were two long fins instead of arms, and the end of the body was
finished by a long tail. The picture I present was given me by
the very illustrious lady, Margaret de Valois, Queen of Navarre,
who received it from a gentleman who gave a similar one to
the emperor, Charles V., then in Spain. This gentleman said
that he had seen the monster as the portrait shows it in Norway,
thrown by the waves and tempests on the beach at a place
called Dieze, near the town called Denelopoch. I have seen a
similar picture at Rome not differing in mien. Among the sea-beasts,
Pliny mentions a sea-mare and a Triton as among the
creatures not imaginary. Pausanias also mentions a Triton."</p>

king of that country, it made
certain signs that it had a
great desire to return to the
sea. Being taken thither it
threw itself instantly into the

<p><b>The Sea-serpent.</b>&mdash;A myth of
especial persistency is that of
the sea-serpent. Most of the
stories of this creature are seaman's
yarns, sometimes based
on a fragment of wreck, a long
strip of kelp, the power of suggestion
or the incitement of
alcohol. But certain of these
tales relate to real fishes. The
sea-serpent with an uprearing
red mane like that of a horse
is the oarfish (<i>Regalecus</i>), a
long, slender, fragile fish compressed
like a ribbon and
reaching a length of 25 feet.
We here present a photograph
of an oarfish (<i>Regalecus russelli</i>)
stranded on the California
coast at Newport in Orange County, California. A figure
of a European species (<i>Regalecus glesne</i>) is also given showing the
fish in its uninjured condition. Another reputed sea-serpent is
the frilled shark (<i>Chlamydoselachus angineus</i>), which has been
occasionally noticed by seamen. The struggles of the great
killer (<i>Orca orca</i>) with the whales it attacks and destroys has
also given rise to stories of the whale struggling in the embrace
of some huge sea-monster. This description is correct, but the
mammal is a monster itself, a relative of the whale and not a
reptile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>It is often hard to account for some of the stories of the sea-serpent.
A gentleman of unquestioned intelligence and sincerity
lately described to the writer a sea-serpent he had seen at
short range, 100 feet long, swimming at the surface, and with
a head as large as a barrel. I do not know what he saw, but I
do know that memory sometimes plays strange freaks.</p>

<p>Little venomous snakes with flattened tails (<i>Platyurus,
Pelamis</i>) are found in the salt bays in many tropical regions of
the Pacific (Gulf of California, Panama, East Indies, Japan),
but these are not the conventional sea-serpents.</p>

<p>Certain slender fishes, as the thread-eel (<i>Nemichthys</i>) and
the wolf-eel (<i>Anarrhichthys</i>), have been brought to naturalists
as young sea-serpents, but these of course are genuine fishes.</p>

<p>Whatever the nature of the sea-serpent may be, this much
is certain, that while many may be seen, none will ever be
caught. The great swimming reptiles of the sea vanished at
the end of Mesozoic time, and as living creatures will never be
known of man.</p>

<p>As a record of the Mythology of Science, we may add the
following remarks of Rafinesque on the imaginary garpike
(<i>Litholepis adamantinus</i>), of which a specimen was painted for
him by the wonderful brush of Audubon:</p>

<p>"This fish may be reckoned the wonder of the Ohio. It is
only found as far up as the falls, and probably lives also in the
Mississippi. I have seen it, but only at a distance, and have
been shown some of its singular scales. Wonderful stories are
related concerning this fish, but I have principally relied upon
the description and picture given me by Mr. Audubon. Its
length is from 4 to 10 feet. One was caught which weighed
400 pounds. It lies sometimes asleep or motionless on the
surface of the water, and may be mistaken for a log or snag. It
is impossible to take it in any other way than with the seine
or a very strong hook; the prongs of the gig cannot pierce the
scales, which are as hard as flint, and even proof against lead
balls! Its flesh is not good to eat. It is a voracious fish. Its
vulgar names are diamond-fish (owing to its scales being cut
like diamonds), devil-fish, jackfish, garjack, etc. The snout
is large, convex above, very obtuse, the eyes small and black;
nostrils small, round before the eyes; mouth beneath the eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
transversal with large angular teeth. Pectoral and abdominal
fins trapezoidal. Dorsal and anal fins equal, longitudinal, with
many rays. The whole body covered with large stone scales,
lying in oblique rows; they are conical, pentagonal pent&aelig;dral,
with equal sides, from half an inch to one inch in diameter,
brown at first but becoming the color of turtle-shell when dry.
They strike fire with steel and are ball-proof!"</p>

CLASSIFICATION OF FISHES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_367.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Taxonomy</span>.</b>&mdash;Classification, as Dr. Elliott Coues has
well said,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> is a natural function of "the mind which
always strives to make orderly disposition of its
knowledge and so to discover the reciprocal relations and
interdependencies of the things it knows. Classification presupposes
that there do exist such relations, according to
which we may arrange objects in the manner which facilitates
their comprehension, by bringing together what is like and
separating what is unlike, and that such relations are the
result of fixed inevitable law. It is therefore taxonomy (&#964;&#8049;&#958;&#953;&#962;,
away; &#957;&#8057;&#956;&#959;&#962;, law) or the rational, lawful disposition of observed
facts."</p>

<p>A perfect taxonomy is one which would perfectly express
all the facts in the evolution and development of the various
forms. It would recognize all the evidence from the three ancestral
documents, pal&aelig;ontology, morphology, and ontogeny. It
would consider structure and form independently of adaptive
or physiological or environmental modifications. It would
regard as most important those characters which had existed
longest unchanged in the history of the species or type. It
would regard as of first rank those characters which appear first
in the history of the embryo. It would regard as of minor
importance those which had arisen recently in response to
natural selection or the forced alteration through pressure of
environment, while fundamental alterations as they appear one
after another in geologic time would make the basal characters
of corresponding groups in taxonomy. In a perfect taxonomy
or natural system of classification animals would not be divided
into groups nor ranged in linear series. We should imagine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>series variously and divergently branched, with each group at
its earlier or lower end passing insensibly into the main or primitive
stock. A very little alteration now and then in some
structure is epoch-making, and paves the way through specialization
to a new class or order. But each class or order through
its lowest types is interlocked with some earlier and otherwise
diverging group.</p>

<p><b>Defects in Taxonomy.</b>&mdash;A sound system of taxonomy of
fishes should be an exact record of the history of their evolution.
But in the limitations of book-making, this transcript
must be made on a flat page, in linear series, while for centuries
and perhaps forever whole chapters must be left vacant and
others dotted everywhere with marks of doubt. For science
demands that positive assertion should not go where certainty
cannot follow. A perfect taxonomy of fishes would be only
possible through the study, by some Artedi, M&uuml;ller, Cuvier,
Agassiz, Traquair, Gill, or Woodward, of all the structures of
all the fishes which have ever lived. There are many fishes
living in the sea which are not yet known to any naturalist,
many others are known from one or two specimens, but not yet
accessible to students in other continents. Many are known
externally from specimens in bottles or drawings in books, but
have not been studied thoroughly by any one, and the vast
multitude of species have perished in Pal&aelig;ozoic, Mesozoic, and
Tertiary seas without leaving a tooth or bone or fin behind
them. With all this goes human fallibility, the marring of
our records, such as they are, by carelessness, prejudice, dependence,
and error. Chief among these defects are the constant
mistaking of analogy for homology, and the inability of men
to trust their own eyes as against the opinion of the greater
men who have had to form their opinions before all evidence
was in. Because of these defects, the current system of classification
is always changing with each accession of knowledge.</p>

<p>The result is, again to quote from Dr. Coues, "that the
natural classification, like the elixir of life or the philosopher's
stone, is a goal far distant."</p>

<p><b>Analogy and Homology.</b>&mdash;<i>Analogy</i>, says Dr. Coues, "is the
apparent resemblance between things really unlike&mdash;as the wing
of a bird and the wing of a butterfly, as the lungs of a bird and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
the gills of a fish. <i>Homology</i> is the real resemblance, or true
relation between things, however different they may appear to
be&mdash;as the wing of a bird and the foreleg of a horse, the lungs
of a bird and the swim-bladder of a fish. The former commonly
rests upon mere functional, i.e. physiological, modifications;
the latter is grounded upon structural, i.e., morphological,
identity or unity. Analogy is the correlative of physiology,
homology of morphology; but the two may be coincident,
as when structures identical in morphology are used for
the same purposes, and are therefore physiologically identical.
Physiological diversity of structure is incessant, and continually
interferes with morphological identity of structure, to
obscure or obliterate the indications of affinity the latter would
otherwise express clearly.... We must be on our guard
against those physiological appearances which are proverbially
deceptive!"</p>

<p>"It is possible and conceivable that every animal should
have been constructed upon a plan of its own, having no resemblance
whatever to the plan of any other animal. For any
reason we can discover to the contrary, that combination of
natural forces which we term life might have resulted from, or
been manifested by, a series of infinitely diverse structures;
nor would anything in the nature of the case lead us to suspect
a community of organization between animals so different in
habit and in appearance as a porpoise and a gazelle, an eagle
and a crocodile, or a butterfly and a lobster. Had animals
been thus independently organized, each working out its life by
a mechanism peculiar to itself, such a classification as that now
under contemplation would be obviously impossible; a morphological
or structural classification plainly implying morphological
or structural resemblances in the things classified.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, however, no such mutual independence
of animal forms exists in nature. On the contrary, the members
of the animal kingdom, from the highest to the lowest, are
marvelously connected. Every animal has something in common
with all its fellows&mdash;much with many of them, more with
a few, and usually so much with several that it differs but little
from them.</p>

<p>"Now, a morphological classification is a statement of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
gradations of likeness which are observable in animal structures,
and its objects and uses are manifold. In the first place, it
strives to throw our knowledge of the facts which underlie,
and are the cause of, the similarities discerned into the fewest
possible general propositions, subordinated to one another, according
to their greater or less degree of generality; and in
this way it answers the purpose of a <i>memoria technica</i>, without
which the mind would be incompetent to grasp and retain the
multifarious details of anatomical science."</p>

<p><b>Coues on Classification.</b>&mdash;It is obvious that fishes like other
animals may be classified in numberless ways, and as a matter
of fact by numberless men they have been classified in all sorts
of fashions. "Systems," again quoting from Dr. Coues, "have
been based on this and that set of characters and erected from
this or that preconception in the mind of the systematist....
The mental point of view was that every species of bird (or of
fish) was a separate creature, and as much of a fixture in nature's
museum as any specimen in a naturalist's cabinet. Crops of
classifications have been sown in the fruitful soil of such blind
error, but no lasting harvest has been reaped.... The
genius of modern taxonomy seems to be so certainly right, to
be tending so surely even if slowly in the direction of the desired
consummation, that all differences of opinion we hope will soon
be settled, and defect of knowledge, not perversity of mind, is
the only obstacle in the way of success. The taxonomic goal is
not now to find the way in which birds (or other animals) may
be most conveniently arranged, but to discover their pedigree,
and so construct their family tree. Such a genealogical table,
or <i>phylum</i> (&#966;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#957;, tribe, race, stock), as it is called, is rightly
considered the only taxonomy worthy the name&mdash;the only true
or natural classification. In attempting this end, we proceed
upon the belief that, as explained above, all birds, like all other
animals and plants, are related to each other genetically, as
offspring are to parents, and that to discover their generic
relations is to bring out their true affinities&mdash;in other words, to
reconstruct the actual taxonomy of nature. In this view
there can be but one 'natural' classification, to the perfecting
of which all increase in our knowledge of the structure of birds
infallibly and inevitably tends. The classification now in use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
or coming into use is the result of our best endeavors to accomplish
this purpose, and represents what approach we have made
to this end. It is one of the great corollaries of that theorem of
evolution which most naturalists are satisfied has been demonstrated.
It is necessarily a <i>morphological classification</i>; that is,
one based solely upon considerations of structure or form (&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#8053;,
form, <i>morphe</i>), and for the following reasons: Every offspring
tends to take on precisely the form or structure of its parents,
as its natural physical heritage; and the principle involved, or
the <i>law of heredity</i>, would, if nothing interfered, keep the descendants
perfectly true to the physical characters of their
progenitors; they would 'breed true' and be exactly alike.
But counter influences are incessantly operative, in consequence
of constantly varying external conditions of environment; the
plasticity of organization of all creatures rendering them more
or less susceptible of modifications by such means, they become
unlike their ancestors in various ways and to different degrees.
On a large scale is thus accomplished, by natural selection and
other natural agencies, just what man does in a small way in
producing and maintaining different breeds of domestic animals.
Obviously, amidst such ceaselessly shifting scenes, degrees
of likeness or unlikeness of physical structure indicate
with the greatest exactitude the nearness or remoteness of
organisms in kinship. Morphological characters derived from
the examination of structure are therefore the surest guides we
can have to the blood relationships we desire to establish; and
such relationships are the 'natural affinities' which all classification
aims to discover and formulate."</p>

<p><b>Species as Twigs of a Genealogical Tree.</b>&mdash;In another essay
Dr. Coues has compared species of animals to "the twigs of a
tree separated from the parent stem. We name and arrange
them arbitrarily in default of a means of reconstructing the
whole tree according to nature's ramifications." If one had a
tree, all in fragments, pieces of twig and stem, some of them
lost, some destroyed, and some not yet separated from the mass
not yet picked over, and wished to place each part where he
could find it, he would be forced to adopt some system of natural
classification. In such a scheme he would lay those parts
together which grew from the same branch. If he were com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>pelled
to arrange all the fragments in a linear series, he would place
together those of one branch, and when these were finished he
would begin with another. If all this were a matter of great
importance and extending over years or over many lifetimes,
with many errors to be made and corrected, a set of names
would be adopted&mdash;for the main trunk, for the chief branches,
the lesser branches, and on down to the twigs and buds.</p>

<p>A task of this sort on a world-wide scale is the problem of
systematic zoology. There is reason to believe that all animals
and plants sprang from a single stock. There is reasonable
certainty that all vertebrate animals are derived from a single
origin. These vertebrate animals stand related to each other,
like the twigs of a gigantic tree of which the lowermost branches
are the aquatic forms to which we give the name of fishes. The
fishes are here regarded as composed of six classes or larger lines
of descent. Each of these, again, is composed of minor divisions
called orders. The different species or ultimate kinds of animals
are grouped in genera. A genus is an assemblage of closely
related species grouped around a central species as type. The
type of a genus is, in common usage, that species with which
the name of the genus was first associated. The name of the
genus as a noun, often with that of the species which is an adjective
in signification if not in form, constitutes the scientific
name of the species. Thus <i>Petromyzon</i> is the genus of the common
large lamprey, <i>marinus</i> is its species, and the scientific
name of the species is <i>Petromyzon marinus</i>. <i>Petromyzon</i> means
stone-sucker; <i>marinus</i>, of the sea, thus distinguishing it from
a species called <i>fluviatilis</i>, of the river. In like fashion all animals
and plants are named in scientific record or taxonomy.
Technical names are necessary because vernacular names fail.
Half a million kinds of animals are known, while not half a
thousand vernacular names exist in any language. And these
are always loosely used, half a dozen of them often for the same
species, one name often for a dozen species.</p>

<p>In the same way, whenever we undertake an exact description,
we must use names especially devised for that purpose.
We cannot use the same names for the bones of the head of a
fish and those of the head of a man, for a fish has a different
series of bones, and this series is different with different fishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Nomenclature.</b>&mdash;A family in zoology is an assemblage of
related genera. The name of a family, for convenience, always
ends in the patronymic <i>id&aelig;</i>, and it is always derived from the
leading genus, that is, the one best known or earliest studied.
Thus all lampreys constitute the family <i>Petromyzonid&aelig;</i>. An
order may contain one or more families. An order is a division
of a larger group; a family an assemblage of related smaller
groups. Intermediate groups are often recognized by the prefixes
sub or super. A subgenus is a division of a genus. A
subspecies is a geographic race or variation within a species; a
super-family a group of allied families. Binomial nomenclature,
or the use of the name of genus and species as a scientific name,
was introduced into science as a systematic method by Linn&aelig;us.
In the tenth edition of his Systema Natur&aelig;, published
in 1758, this method was first consistently applied to animals.
By common consent the scientific naming of animals begins
with this year, and no account is taken of names given earlier,
as these are, except by accident, never binomial. Those authors
who wrote before the adoption of the rule of binomials and
those who neglected it are alike "ruled out of court." The
idea of genus and species was well understood before Linn&aelig;us,
but the specific name used was not one word but a descriptive
phrase, and this phrase was changed at the whim of the different
authors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 239.</span>&mdash;Horned Trunkfish, Cowfish, or Cuckold, <i>Lactophrys tricornis</i> (Linn&aelig;us).
Charleston, S. C.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Nomenclature of Trunkfishes.</b>&mdash;Examples of such names are
those of the West Indian trunkfish, or cuckold (<i>Ostracion
tricorne</i>, Linn&aelig;us). Lister refers to a specimen in 1686 as
"<i>Piscis triangularis capiti cornutu cui e media cauda cutanea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
aculeus longus erigitus</i>." This Artedi alters in 1738 to <i>Ostracion
triangulatus aculeis duobus in capite et unico longiore superne
ad caudam</i>. This is more accurately descriptive and it recognizes
the existence of a generic type, <i>Ostracion</i>, or trunkfish, to
cover all similar fishes. French writers transformed this into
various phrases beginning "Coffre triangulaire &agrave; trois cornes,"
or some similar descriptive epithet, and in English or German it
was likely to wander still farther from the original. But Linn&aelig;us
condenses it all in the word <i>tricornis</i>, which, although not
fully descriptive, is still a name which all future observers can
use and recognize.</p>

<p>It is true that common consent fixes the date of the beginning
of nomenclature at 1758. But to this there are many
exceptions. Some writers date genera from the first recognition
of a collective idea under a single name. Others follow
even species back through the occasional accidental binomials.
Most British writers have chosen the final and completed
edition of the Systema Natur&aelig;, the last work of Linn&aelig;us, in
1766, in preference to the earlier volume. But all things considered,
justice and convenience alike seem best served by
the use of the edition of 1758.</p>

<p><b>Synonymy and Priority.</b>&mdash;Synonymy is the record of the
names applied at different times to the same group or species.
With characteristic pungency Dr. Coues defines synonymy as
"a burden and a disgrace to science." It has been found that
the only way to prevent utter confusion is to use for each
genus or species the first name applied to it and no other.
The first name, once properly given, is sacred because it is
the right name. All other later names whatever their appropriateness
are wrong names. In science, of necessity, a name
is a name without any necessary signification. For this reason
and for the further avoidance of confusion, it remains as it was
originally spelled by the author, obvious misprints aside, regardless
of all possible errors in classical form or meaning.
The names in use are properly written in Latin or in
Latinized Greek, the Greek forms being usually preferred as
generic names, the Latin adjectives for names of species. Many
species are named in honor of individuals, these names being
usually given the termination of the Latin genitive, as <i>Sebas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>todes
gillii, Liparis agassizi</i>. In recent custom all specific names
are written with the small initial; all generic names with the
capital.</p>

<p>One class of exceptions must be made to the law of priority.
No generic name can be used twice among animals, and no
specific name twice in the same genus. Thus the name <i>Diabasis</i>
has to be set aside in favor of the next name <i>H&aelig;mulon</i>, because
<i>Diabasis</i> was earlier used for a genus of beetles. The specific
name <i>Pristipoma humile</i> is abandoned, because there was already
a <i>humile</i> in the genus <i>Pristipoma</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Conception of Genus.</b>&mdash;In the system of Linn&aelig;us, a genus
corresponds roughly to the modern conception of a family.
Most of the primitive genera contained a great variety of forms,
as well as usually some species belonging to other groups disassociated
from their real relationships.</p>

<p>As greater numbers of species have become known the earlier
genera have undergone subdivision until in the modern systems
almost any structural character not subject to intergradation
and capable of exact definition is held to distinguish a genus.
As the views of these characters are undergoing constant change,
and as different writers look upon them from different points of
view, or with different ideas of convenience, we have constant
changes in the boundaries of genera. This brings constant
changes in the scientific names, although the same specific name
should be used whatever the generic name to which it may be
attached. We may illustrate these changes and the burden of
synonymy as well by a concrete example.</p>

<p><b>The Trunkfishes.</b>&mdash;The horned trunkfish, or cuckold, of the
West Indies was first recorded by Lister in 1686, in the descriptive
phrase above quoted. Artedi, in 1738, recognized that it
belonged with other trunkfishes in a group he called <i>Ostracion</i>.
This, to be strictly classic, he should have written <i>Ostracium</i>,
but he preferred a partly Greek form to the Latin one. In the
Nagg's Head Inn in London, Artedi saw a trunkfish he thought
different, having two spines under the tail, while Lister's figure
seemed to show one spine above. This Nagg's Head specimen
Artedi called "<i>Ostracion triangulatus duobus aculeis in fronte et
totidem in imo ventre subcaudalesque binis</i>."</p>

<p>Next came Linn&aelig;us, 1758, who named Lister's figure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
the species it represented, <i>Ostracion tricornis</i>, which should in
strictness have been <i>Ostracion tricorne</i>, as &#8000;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#8055;&#959;&#957;, a little
box, is a neuter diminutive. The Nagg's Head fish he named
<i>Ostracion quadricornis</i>. The right name now is <i>Ostracion tricornis</i>,
because the name <i>tricornis</i> stands first on the page in
Linn&aelig;us' work, but <i>Ostracion quadricornis</i> has been more often
used by subsequent authors because it is more truthful as a
descriptive phrase. In 1798, Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de changed the name of
Lister's fish to <i>Ostracion listeri</i>, a needless alteration which
could only make confusion.</p>

(After Bleeker.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1818, Dr. Samuel Latham Mitchill, receiving a specimen
from below New Orleans, thought it different from <i>tricornis</i>
and <i>quadricornis</i> and called it <i>Ostracion sexcornutus</i>; Dr. Holard,
of Paris, in 1857, named a specimen <i>Ostracion maculatus</i>,
and at about the same time Bleeker named two others from
Africa which seem to be the same thing, <i>Ostracion guineensis</i>
and <i>Ostracion gronovii</i>. Lastly, Poey calls a specimen from
Cuba <i>Acanthostracion polygonius</i>, thinking it different from all
the rest, which it may be, although my own judgment is otherwise.
This brings up the question of the generic name. Among
trunkfishes there are four-angled and three-angled kinds, and
of each form there are species with and without horns and
spines. The original <i>Ostracion</i> of Linn&aelig;us we may interpret
as being <i>Ostracion cubicus</i> of the coasts of Asia, a species similar
to the <i>Ostracion rhinorhynchus</i>. This species, <i>cubicus</i>, we call
the type species of the genus, as the Nagg's Head specimen of
Artedi was the type specimen of the species <i>quadricornus</i>, and
the one that was used for Lister's figure the type specimen of
<i>tricornis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ostracion cubicus</i> is a four-angled species, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
trunkfishes were regarded as a family (<i>Ostraciid&aelig;</i>), the three-angled
ones were set off as a separate genus. For this two
names were offered, both by Swainson in 1839. For <i>trigonus</i>,
a species without horns before the eyes, he gave the name <i>Lactophrys</i>,
and for <i>triqueter</i>, a species without spines anywhere,
the name of <i>Rhinesomus</i>. Most recent American authors have
placed the three-cornered species which are
mostly American in one genus, which must
therefore be called <i>Lactophrys</i>. Of this name
<i>Rhinesomus</i> is a synonym, and our species
should stand as <i>Lactophrys tricornis</i>. The fact
that <i>Lactophrys</i> as a word (from Latin <i>l&aelig;tus</i>,
smooth; Greek &#8000;&#966;&#961;&#8059;&#962;, eyebrow; or else from
<i>lactoria</i>, a milk cow, and &#8000;&#966;&#961;&#8059;&#962;) is either
meaningless or incorrectly written makes no
difference with the necessity for its use.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1862, Bleeker undertook to divide these
fishes differently. Placing all the hornless
species, whether three-angled or four-angled,
in <i>Ostracion</i>, he proposed the name <i>Acanthostracion</i> for the
species with horns, <i>tricornis</i> being the type. But <i>Acanthostracion</i>
has not been usually adopted except as the name of a
section under <i>Lactophrys</i>. The three-angled American species
are usually set apart from the four-angled species of Asia, and
our cuckold is called <i>Lactophrys tricornis</i>. But it may be with
perfect correctness called <i>Ostracion tricorne</i>, in the spirit called
conservative. Or with the "radical" systematists we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
accept the finer definition and again correctly call it <i>Acanthostracion
tricorne</i>. But to call it <i>quadricornis</i> or <i>listeri</i> or <i>maculatus</i>
with any generic name whatever would be to violate the
law of priority.</p>

<p><b>Trinomial Nomenclature.</b>&mdash;By trinomial nomenclature we mean
the use of a second subordinate specific name to designate
a geographic subspecies, variety, or other intergrading race.
Thus <i>Salmo clarki virginalis</i> indicates the variety of Clark's
trout, or the cut-throat trout, found in the lakes and streams of
the Great Basin of Utah, as distinguished from the genuine
<i>Salmo clarkii</i> of the Columbia. Trinomials are not much used
among fishes, as we are not yet able to give many of the local
forms correct and adequate definition such as is awarded to
similar variations among birds and mammals. Usually varieties
in ichthyology count as species or as nothing.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Meaning of Species.</b>&mdash;Quoting once more from the admirable
essay of Dr. Coues on the taxonomy of birds: "The student
cannot be too well assured that no such things as species, in the
old sense of the word, exist in nature any more than have
genera or families an actual existence.
Indeed they cannot be, if there is
any truth in the principles discussed
in our earlier paragraphs. Species
are simply ulterior modifications,
which once were, if they be not still,
inseparably linked together; and their
nominal recognition is a pure convention,
like that of a genus. More
practically hinges upon the way we
regard them than turns upon our establishment
of higher groups, simply
because upon the way we decide in this case depends the scientific
labeling of specimens. If we are speaking of a robin, we
do not ordinarily concern ourselves with the family or order it
belongs to, but we do require a technical name for constant use.
That name is compounded of its genus, species, and variety.
No infallible rule can be laid down for determining what shall
be held to be a species, what a conspecies, subspecies, or variety.
It is a matter of tact and experience, like the appreciation of
the value of any other group in zoology. There is, however, a
convention upon the subject, which the present workers in ornithology
in this country find available; at any rate we have no
better rule to go by. We treat as "specific" any form, however
little different from the next, that we do not know or believe
to intergrade with that next one, between which and the
next one no intermediate equivocal specimens are forthcoming,
and none, consequently, are supposed to exist. This is to imply
that differentiation is accomplished, the links are lost and the
characters actually become "specific." We treat as "varietal"
of each other any forms, however different in their extreme
manifestation, which we know to intergrade, having the intermediate
specimens before us, or which we believe with any good
reason do intergrade. If the links still exist, the differentiation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
is still incomplete, and the characters are not specific, but only
varietal, in the literal sense of these terms."</p>

<p><b>Generalization and Specialization.</b>&mdash;A few terms in common
use may receive a moment's discussion. A type or group is said
to be specialized when it has a relatively large number of peculiarities
or when some one peculiarity is carried to an extreme.
A sculpin is a specialized fish having many unusual phases of
development, as is also a swordfish, which has a highly peculiar
structure in the snout. A generalized type is one with fewer
peculiarities, as the herring in comparison with the sculpin. In
the process of evolution generalized types usually give place to
specialized ones. Generalized types are therefore as a rule
archaic types. The terms high and low are also relative, a
high type being one with varied structure and functions. Low
types may be primitively generalized, as the lancelet in comparison
with all other fishes, or the herring in comparison with
the perch, or they may be due to degradation, a loss of structures
which have been elaborately specialized in their ancestry.
The sea-snail (<i>Liparis</i>), an ally of the sculpin, with scales lost
and fins deteriorated is an example of a low type which is specialized
as well as degraded.</p>

<p><b>High and Low Forms.</b>&mdash;In the earlier history of ichthyology
much confusion resulted from the misconception of the terms
"high" and "low." Because sharks appeared earlier than
bony fishes, it was assumed that they should be lower than any
of their subsequent descendants. That the brain and muscular
system in sharks was more highly developed than in most bony
fishes seemed also certain. Therefore it was thought that the
teleost series could not have had a common origin with the
series of sharks. It is now understood that evolution means
chiefly adaptation. The teleost is adapted to its mode of life,
and to that end it is specialized in fin and skeleton rather than
in brain and nerves. All degeneration is associated with specialization.
The degeneration of the blindfish is a specialization
for better adaptation to life in the darkness of caves; the
degeneration of the deep-sea fish meets the demands of the
depths, the degeneration of the globefish means the sinking of
one line of functions in the extension of some other.</p>

<p>Referring to his own work on the fossil fishes in the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
forties, Professor Agassiz once said to the writer: "At that
time I was on the verge of anticipating the views of Darwin,
but it seemed to me that the facts were contrary to the theories
of evolution. We had the highest fishes first." This statement
leads us to consider what is meant by high and low. Undoubtedly
the sharks are higher than the bony fishes in the sense of
being nearer to the higher vertebrates. In brain, muscle, teeth,
and reproductive structures they are also more highly developed.
In all skeletal and cranial characters the sharks stand
distinctly lower. But the essential fact, so far as evolution is
concerned, is not that the sharks are high or low. They are, in
almost all respects, distinctly generalized and primitive. The
bony fishes are specialized in various ways through adaptation
to the various modes of life they lead. Much of this specialization
involves corresponding degeneration of organs whose functions
have ceased to be important. As a broad proposition it is
not true that "we had our highest fishes first," for in a complete
definition of high and low, the specialized perch or bass stands
higher. But whether true or not, it does not touch the question
of evolution which is throughout a process of adaptation to
conditions of life.</p>

<p>Referring to the position of Agassiz and his early friend and
disciple, Hugh Miller, Dr. Traquair (1900) uses these words in an
address at Bradford, England:</p>

<p>"It cannot but be acknowledged that the paleontology of
fishes is not less emphatic in the support of descent than that of
any other division of the animal kingdom. But in former days
the evidence of fossil ichthyology was by some read otherwise.</p>

<p>"It is now a little over forty years since Hugh Miller died:
he who was one of the first collectors of the fossil fishes of the
Scottish old red sandstone, and who knew these in some respects
better than any other man of his time, not excepting
Agassiz himself. Yet his life was spent in a fierce denunciation
of the doctrine of evolution, then only in its Lamarckian form,
as Darwin had not yet electrified the world with his 'Origin of
Species.' Many a time I wonder greatly what Hugh Miller
would have thought had he lived a few years longer, so as to
have been able to see the remarkable revolution which was
wrought by the publication of that book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>"The main argument on which Miller rested was the 'high'
state of organization of the ancient fishes of the Paleozoic formations,
and this was apparently combined with a confident
assumption of the completeness of the geological record. As
to the first idea, we know of course that evolution means the
passage from the more general to the more special, and that as
the general result an onward advance has taken place; yet
'specialization' does not always or necessarily mean 'highness'
of organization in the sense in which the term is usually employed.
As to the idea of the perfection of the geological
record, that of course is absurd.</p>

<p>"We do not and cannot know the oldest fishes, as they
would not have had hard parts for preservation, but we may
hope to come to know many more old ones, and older ones still
than we do at present. My experience on the subject of fossil
ichthyology is that it is not likely to become exhausted in our
day.</p>

<p>"We are introduced at a period far back in geological history
to certain groups of fishes, some of which certainly are
high in organization as animals, but yet of generalized type,
being fishes and yet having the potentiality of higher forms.
But because their ancestors are unknown to us, that it is no
evidence that they did not exist, and cannot overthrow the
morphological testimony in favor of evolution with which the
record actually does furnish us. We may therefore feel very
sure that fishes or 'fish-like vertebrates' lived long ages before
the oldest forms with which we are acquainted came into existence.</p>

<p>"The modern type of bony fishes, though not so 'high' in
many anatomical points as that of the Selachii, Crossopterygii,
Dipnoi, Acipenseroidei, and Lepidosteoidei of the Pal&aelig;ozoic
and Mesozoic eras, is more specialized in the direction of the
fish proper, and, as already indicated, specialization and 'highness'
in the ordinary sense of the word are not necessarily coincident.
But ideas about these things have undergone a wonderful
change since those pre-Darwinian days, and though we
shall never be able fully to unravel the problems concerning the
descent of animals, we see many things a great deal more clearly
now than we did then."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Gill observes: "Perhaps there are no words in science
that have been productive of more mischief and more retarded
the progress of biological taxonomy than those words pregnant
with confusion, High and Low, and it were to be wished that
they might be erased from scientific terminology. They deceive
the person to whom they are addressed. They insensibly
mislead the one who uses them. Psychological prejudices
and fancies are so inextricably associated with these words
that the use of them is provocative of such ideas. The words,
generalized and specialized, having become almost limited to
the expression of the ideas which the scientific biologist wishes
to unfold by the others, can with great gain be employed in
their stead." ("Families of Fishes," 1872.)</p>

<p><b>The Problem of the Highest Fishes.</b>&mdash;As to which fishes
should be ranked highest and which lowest, Dr. Gill gives ("Families
of Fishes," 1872) the following useful discussion: "While
among the mammals there is almost universal concurrence as
to the forms entitled to the first as well as the last places, naturalists
differ much as to the 'highest' of the ichthyoid vertebrates,
but are all of one accord respecting the form to be designated
as the 'lowest.' With that admitted lowest form as a
starting-point, inquiry may be made respecting the forms which
are successively <i>most nearly related</i>.</p>

<p>"No dissent has ever been expressed from the proposition
that the Leptocardians (<i>Branchiostoma</i>) are the lowest of the
vertebrates; while they have doubtless deviated much from
the representatives of the immediate line of descent of the
higher vertebrates, and are probably specialized considerably,
in some respects, in comparison with those vertebrates from
which they (in common with the higher forms) have descended,
they undoubtedly have diverged far less, and furnish a better
hint as to the protovertebrates than any other form.</p>

<p>"Equally undisputed it is that most nearly related to the
Leptocardians are the Marsipobranchiates (<i>Lampreys</i>, etc.),
and the tendency has been rather to overlook the fundamental
differences between the two, and to approximate them too
closely, than the reverse.</p>

<p>"But here unanimity ends, and much difference of opinion
has prevailed with respect to the succession in the system of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
several subclasses (by whatever name called) of true fishes: (1) Some
(e.g., Cuvier, J. M&uuml;ller, Owen, L&uuml;tken, Cope) arranging
next to the lowest the Elasmobranchiates, and, as successive
forms, the Ganoids and Teleosteans; (2) while others (e.g.,
Agassiz, Dana, Dum&eacute;ril, G&uuml;nther) adopt the sequence Leptocardians,
Marsipobranchiates, Teleosteans, Ganoids, and Elasmobranchiates.
The source of this difference of opinion is
evident and results partly from metaphysical or psychological
considerations, and partly from those based (in the case of the
Ganoids) on real similarities and affinities.</p>

<p>"The evidence in favor of the title of the Elasmobranchiates
to the 'highest' rank is based upon (1) the superior development
of the brain; (2) the development of the egg, and the
ovulation; (3) the possession of a placenta; and (4) the complexity
of the organs of generation.</p>

<p>"(1) It has not been definitely stated wherein the superior
development of the brain consists, and as it is not evident to
the author, the vague claim can only be met by this simple
statement; it may be added, however, that the brains comparable
in essentials and most similar as a whole to those of the
Marsipobranchiates are those of the sharks. In answer to the
statement that the sharks exhibit superior intelligence, and
thus confirm the indications of cerebral structure, it may be
replied that the impression is a subjective one, and the author
has not been thus influenced by his own observations of their
habits. Psychological manifestations, at any rate, furnish too
vague criteria to be available in exact taxonomy.</p>

<p>"(2) If the development of the eggs, their small number,
and their investment in cases are arguments in favor of the
high rank of the Elasmobranchiates, they are also for the Marsipobranchiates,
and thus prove too much or too little for the
advocates of the views discussed. The variation in number of
progeny among true fishes (e.g., Cyprinodonts, <i>Embiotocids</i>)
also demonstrates the unreliability of those modifications
<i>per se</i>.</p>

<p>"(3) The so-called placenta of some Elasmobranchiates
may be <i>analogous</i> to that of mammals, but that it is not <i>homologous</i>
(i.e., homogenetic) is demonstrable from the fact that all
the forms intervening between them and the specialized pla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>cental
mammals are devoid of a placenta, and by the variation
(presence or want) among the Elasmobranchiates themselves.</p>

<p>"(4) The organs of generation in the Elasmobranchiates
are certainly more complex than in most other fishes, but as
the complexity results from specialization of parts <i>sui generis</i>
and different from those of the higher (quadruped) vertebrates,
it is not evident what bearing the argument has. If it is claimed
simply on the ground of specialization, irrespective of homological
agreement with admitted higher forms, then are we
equally entitled to claim any specialization of parts as evidence
of high rank, or at least we have not been told within what
limits we should be confined. The Cetaceans, for example,
are excessively specialized mammals, and, on similar grounds,
would rank above the other mammals and man; the aye-aye
exhibits in its dentition excessive specialization and deviation
from the primitive type (as exhibited in its own milk teeth) of
the Primates, and should thus also rank above man. It is
true that in other respects the higher primates (even including
man) may be more specialized, but the specialization is not as
obvious as in the cases referred to, and it is not evident how we
are to balance <i>irrelative</i> specializations against each other, or
even how we shall subordinate such cases. We are thus compelled
by the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> to the confession that irrelative
specialization of single organs is untrustworthy, and are
fain to return to that better method of testing affinities by the
equation of agreement in whole and after the elimination of
special teleological modifications.</p>

<p>"The question then recurs, What forms are the most <i>nearly
allied</i> to the Marsipobranchiates, and what show the closest
approach in <i>characteristic</i> features? And in response thereto
the evidence is not undecisive. Wide as is the gap between
Marsipobranchiates and fishes, and comparatively limited as is
the range of the latter among themselves, the Elasmobranchiates
are very appreciably more like, and share more characters in
common with them, than any other; so much is this the case
that some eminent naturalists (e.g., Pallas, Geoffroy, St. Hilaire,
Latreille, Agassiz, formerly L&uuml;tken) have combined the two
forms in a peculiar group, contradistinguished from the other
fishes. The most earnest and extended argument in English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
in favor of this combination has been published by Professor
Agassiz in his 'Lake Superior,' but that eminent naturalist
subsequently arrived at the opposite conclusions already indicated.</p>

<p>"The evidences of the closer affinity of the Elasmobranchiates
(than of any other fishes) with the Marsipobranchiates
are furnished by (1) the cartilaginous condition of the skeleton;
(2) the post-cephalic position of the branchi&aelig;; (3) the
development of the branchi&aelig; and their restriction to special
chambers; (4) the larger number of the branchi&aelig;; (5) the
imperfect development of the skull; (6) the mode of attachment
of the teeth; (7) the slight degree of specialization of the
rays of the fins; and (8) the rudimentary condition of the
shoulder-girdle."</p>

THE HISTORY OF ICHTHYOLOGY</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_387.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Science</span> consists of human experience, tested and
placed in order. The science of ichthyology represents
our knowledge of fishes, derived from varied
experiences of man, tested by methods or instruments of
precision and arranged in orderly sequence. This science, in
common with every other, is the work of many persons, each
in his own field, and each contributing a series of facts, a
series of tests of the alleged facts of others, or some improvement
in the method of arrangement. As in other branches
of science, this work has been done by sincere, devoted men,
impelled by a love for this kind of labor, and having in view,
as "the only reward they asked, a grateful remembrance of
their work." And in token of this reward it is well sometimes,
in grateful spirit, to go over the names of those who made
even its present stage of completeness possible.</p>

<p>We may begin the history of ichthyology with that of so
many others of the sciences, with the work of Aristotle (383-322
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>). This wonderful observer recorded many facts concerning
the structure and habits of the fishes of Greece, and in
almost every case his actual observation bears the closest modern
test. These observations were hardly "set in order." The
number of species he knew was small, about 118 in all, and it
did not occur to him that they needed classification. His ideas
of species were those of the fishermen, and the local vernacular
supplied him with the only names needed in his records.</p>

<p>As Dr. G&uuml;nther wisely observes, "It is less surprising that
Aristotle should have found so many truths as that none of his
followers should have added to them." For nearly 1800 years
the scholars of the times copied the words of Aristotle, confus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>ing
them by the addition of fabulous stories and foolish superstitions,
never going back to nature herself, "who leads us to
absolute truth whenever we wander." A few observations
were made by Caius Plinius, Claudius &AElig;lianus, Athen&aelig;us and
others. Theophrastus (370-270 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) wrote on the fishes
which may live out of water. About 400 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, Decius Magnus
Ausonius wrote a pleasing little poem on the Moselle, setting
forth the merits of its various fishes. It was not, however,
until the middle of the seventeenth century that any advance
was made in the knowledge of fishes. At that time the development
of scholarship among the nations of Europe was such
that a few wise men were able to grasp the idea of species.</p>

<p>In 1553, Pierre B&eacute;lon (1518-64) published his octavo volume
of 448 pages, entitled "De Aquatilibus," in which numerous
(110) species of fishes of the Mediterranean were described,
with tolerable figures, and with these is a creditable attempt
at classification. At about this time Ulysses Aldrovandi, of
Bologna, founded the first museum of natural history and
wrote on the fishes it contained. In 1554-58, Ippolito Salviani
(1513-72), a physician at Rome, published a work entitled
"Aquatilium Animalium Historia," with good figures of most
of the species, together with much general information as to the
value and habits of animals of the sea.</p>

<p>More important than these, but almost simultaneous with
them, is the great work of Guillaume Rondelet (1507-57), "De
Piscibus Marinus" (1554-55), at first written in Latin, later
translated into French and enlarged under other titles. In
this work, 244 different species, chiefly from the Mediterranean,
are fairly described, and the various fables previously current
are subjected to severe scrutiny. Recognizable woodcuts represent
the different species. Classification, Rondelet had none,
except as simple categories for purposes of convenience. More
than usual care is given to the vernacular names, French and
Greek. He closes his book with these words:</p>

<p>"Or s'il en i a qui prennent les choses tant &agrave; la rigueur, qui
ne veulent rien apparouver qui ne soit du tout parfait, je les
prie de bien bon cueur de traiter telle, ou quelque autre histoire
parfaitement, sans qu'il i ait chose quelconque &agrave; redire
et la receverons &eacute; haut louerons bien vouluntiers. Cependant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
je scai bien, et me console . . . avec grand travail . . . qu'on
pourra trouver plusieurs bones choses e dignes de louange
ou proufit &eacute; contentement des homes studieux &eacute; &agrave; l'honneur &eacute;
grandissime admiration des tres excellens &eacute; perfaits &oelig;uvres de
Dieu."</p>

<p>And with the many "bones choses" of the work of Rondelet,
men were too long satisfied, and it was not until the impulse
of commerce had brought them face to face with new series
of animals not found in the Mediterranean that the work of
investigating fishes was again resumed. About 1640, Prince
Moritz (Maurice) of Nassau (1604-79) visited Brazil, taking
with him two physicians, Georg Marcgraf (1610-44) and Wilhelm
Piso. In the great work "Historia Naturalis Brasili&aelig;,"
published at Leyden (1648), Marcgraf described about one
hundred species, all new to science, under Portuguese names
and with a good deal of spirit and accuracy. This work was
printed by Piso after Marcgraf's death, and his colored drawings&mdash;long
afterward used by Bloch&mdash;are in the "History of
Brazil" reduced to small and crude woodcuts. This is the first
study of a local fish fauna outside the Mediterranean region
and it reflects great credit on Marcgraf and on the illustrious
prince whose assistant he was.</p>

<p>There were no other similar attempts of importance in
ichthyology for a hundred years, when Per Osbeck, an enthusiastic
student of Linn&aelig;us, published (1757) the records of his
cruise to China, under the name of "Iter Chinensis." At about
the same time another of Linn&aelig;us' students, Fredrik Hasselquist,
published, in his "Iter Palestinum" the account of his
discoveries of fishes in Palestine and Egypt. More pretentious
than these and of much value as an early record is Mark
Catesby's (1679-1749) "Natural History of Carolina and the
Bahamas," published in 1749, with large colored plates which
are fairly correct except in those cases in which the drawing
was made from memory.</p>

<p>At about the same time, Hans Sloane (1660-1752) published
his large volume on the "Fishes of Jamaica," Patrick Browne
(1720-90) wrote on the fishes of the same region, while Father
Charles Plumier (1646-1704) made paintings of the fishes of
Martinique, long after used by Bloch and Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de. Dr. Alex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>ander
Garden (1730-91), of Charleston, S. C., collected fishes
for Linn&aelig;us, as did also Dr. Pehr Kalm in his travels in the
northern parts of the American colonies.</p>

<p>With the revival of interest in general anatomy several
naturalists took up the structure of fishes. Among these G&uuml;nther
mentions Borelli, Malpighi, Swammerdam, and Duverney.
Other anatomists of later dates were Albrecht von Heller (1708-77),
Peter Camper (1722-89), Felix Vicq d'Azyr (1748-94),
and Alexander Monro (1783).</p>

<p>The basis of classification was first fairly recognized by
John Ray (1628-1705) and Francis Willughby (1635-72), who,
with other and varied scientific labors, undertook, in the "Historia
Piscium," published in Oxford in 1686, to bring order out
of the confusion left by their predecessors. This work, edited
by Ray after Willughby's death, is ostensibly the work of Willughby
with additions by Ray. In this work 420 species were
recorded, 180 of which were actually examined by the authors,
and the arrangement chosen by them pointed the way to a
final system of nomenclature.</p>

<p>Direct efforts in this direction, with a fairly clear recognition
of genera as well as species, were made by Lorenz Theodor
Gronow, called Gronovius, a German naturalist of much acumen,
and by Jacob Theodor Klein (1685-1757), whose work,
"Historic Naturalis Piscium," published about 1745, is of less
importance, not being much of an advance over the catalogue
of Rondelet.</p>

<p>Far greater than any of these investigators, and earlier than
either Klein or Gronow, was he who has been justly called the
Father of Ichthyology, Petrus (Peter) Artedi (1705-35). Artedi
was born in Sweden. He was a fellow student of Linn&aelig;us at
Upsala, and he devoted his short life wholly to the study of
fishes. He went to Holland to examine the collection of East
and West Indian fishes of a rich Dutch merchant in Amsterdam
named Albert Seba, and there at the age of twenty-nine
he was, by accident, drowned in one of the Dutch canals. "His
manuscripts were fortunately rescued by an Englishman,
Cliffort," and they were edited and published by Linn&aelig;us in a
series of five parts or volumes.</p>

<p>Artedi divided the class of fishes into orders, and these orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
again into genera, the genera into species. The name of each
species consisted of that of the genus with a descriptive phrase
attached. This cumbersome system, called polynomial, used
by Artedi, Gronow, Klein, and others, was a great advance on
the shifting vernacular, of which it now took the place. But
the polynomial method as a system was of short duration.
Linn&aelig;us soon substituted for it the convenient, in fact inevitable
binomial system which has now endured for 150 years,
and which with certain modifications must form the permanent
substructure of the nomenclature in systematic zoology
and botany.</p>

<p>The genera of Artedi are in almost all cases natural groups,
corresponding essentially equivalent to the families of to-day.
Families in ichthyology were first clearly recognized and defined
by Cuvier.</p>

<p>The following is a list of Artedi's genera and their arrangement:</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>In all 47 genera and 230 species of fishes were known from
the whole world in 1738.</p>

<p>The cetaceans, or whales, constitute a fifth order, Plagiuri,
in Artedi's scheme.</p>

<p>As examples of the nomenclature of species I may quote:</p>

<p>"<i>Zeus ventre aculeato, cauda in extremo circinata.</i>" This
polynomial expression was shortened by Linn&aelig;us to <i>Zeus faber</i>.
The species was called by Rondelet "<i>Faber sive Gallus Marinus</i>"
and by other authors "<i>Piscis Jovii</i>." "Jovii" suggested <i>Zeus</i>
to Artedi, and Rondelet's name <i>faber</i> became the specific name.</p>

<p>"<i>Anarhichas Lupus marinus nostras.</i>" This became with
Linn&aelig;us "<i>Anarhichas lupus</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Clupea, maxilla inferiore longiore, maculis nigris carens:
Harengus vel Chalcis Auctorum, Herring vel Hering Anglis,
Germanis Belgis.</i>" This became <i>Clupea harengus</i> in the convenient
binomial system of Linn&aelig;us.</p>

<p>The great naturalist of the eighteenth century, Carl von
Linn&eacute;, known academically as Carolus Linn&aelig;us, was the early
associate and close friend of Artedi, and from Artedi he obtained
practically all his knowledge of fishes. Linn&aelig;us, professor
in the University of Upsala and for a time its rector, primarily
a botanist, was a man of wonderful erudition, and his great
strength lay in his skill in the orderly arrangement of things.
In his lifetime, his greatest work, the "Systema Natur&aelig;,"
passed through twelve editions. In the tenth edition, in 1758,
the binomial system of nomenclature was first consistently
applied to all animals. For this reason most naturalists use
the date of its publication as the beginning of zoological nomenclature,
although the English naturalists have generally preferred
the more complete twelfth edition, published in 1766.
This difference in the recognized starting-point has been often
a source of confusion, as in several cases the names of species
were needlessly changed by Linn&aelig;us and given differently in
the twelfth edition. In taxonomy it is not nearly so important
that a name be pertinent or even well chosen as that it be
stable. In changing his own established names, the father
of classification set a bad example to his successors, one which
they did not fail to follow.</p>

<p>In Linn&aelig;us' system (tenth and twelfth editions) all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
Artedi's genera were retained save <i>Lepturus</i>, which name was
changed to <i>Trichiurus</i>. The following new genera were added:
<i>Chim&aelig;ra</i>, <i>Tetraodon</i>, <i>Diodon</i>, <i>Centriscus</i>, <i>Pegasus</i>, <i>Callionymus</i>,
<i>Uranoscopus</i>, <i>Cepola</i>, <i>Mullus</i>, <i>Teuthis</i>, <i>Loricaria</i>, <i>Fistularia</i>,
<i>Atherina</i>, <i>Mormyrus</i>, <i>Polynemus</i>, <i>Amia</i>, <i>Elops</i>. The classification
was finally much altered: the Chondropterygia and Branchiostegi
(with <i>Syngnathus</i>) being called <i>Amphibia Nantes</i>, and
divided into two groups&mdash;<i>Spiraculis compositis</i> and <i>Spiraculis
solitariis</i>. The other fishes were more naturally distributed
according to the position of the ventral fins into Pisces Apodes,
Jugulares, Thoracici, and Abdominales. The Apodes of Linn&aelig;us
do not form a homogeneous group, as members of various
distinct groups have lost their ventral fins in the process of
evolution. But the Jugulares, the Thoracici, and the Abdominales
must be kept as valid categories in any natural system.</p>

<p>Linn&aelig;us' contributions to zoology consisted mainly of the
introduction of his most ingenious and helpful system of bookkeeping.
By it naturalists of all lands were able to speak of
the same species by the same name in whatever tongue. Unfortunately,
ignorance, carelessness, and perversity brought
about a condition of confusion. For a long period many species
were confounded under one name. This source of confusion
began with Linn&aelig;us himself. On the other hand, even with
Linn&aelig;us, the same species often appeared under several different
names; in this matter it was not the system of naming
which was at fault. It was the lack of accurate knowledge,
and sometimes the lack of just and conscientious dealing with
the work of other men. No system of naming can go beyond
the knowledge on which it rests. Ignorance of fact produces
confusion in naming. The earlier naturalists had no conception
of the laws of geographical distribution. The "Indies,"
East or West, were alike to them, and "America" or "India"
or "Africa" was a sufficiently exact record of the origin of any
specimen.</p>

<p>Moreover, no thought of the geological past of groups and
species had yet arisen, and without the conception of common
origin, the facts of homology had no significance. All classification
was simply a matter of arbitrary pigeon-holing the records
of forms, rather than an expression of actual blood rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>tionship.
To this confusion much was added through love of
novelty. Different authors changed names to suit their personal
tastes regardless of rights of priority. <i>Amia</i> was altered
to <i>Amiatus</i> by Rafinesque in 1815 because it was too short a
name. <i>Hiodon</i> was changed to <i>Amphiodon</i> because it sounded
too much like <i>Diodon</i>, <i>Batrachoides</i> to <i>Batrictius</i> because
&#946;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8049;&#967;&#959;&#962; means a frog, not a fish, and other changes even more
wanton were introduced, to be condemned and discarded by
the more methodical workers of a later period. With all its
abuses, however, the binomial nomenclature made possible systematic
zoology and botany, and with the "Systema Natur&aelig;"
arose a new era in the science of living organisms.</p>

<p>In common with most naturalists of his day, the spirit of
Linn&aelig;us was essentially a devout one. Admiration for the
wonderful works of God was breathed on almost every page.
"O Jehovah! quam ampla sunt opera Tua" is on the title-page
of the "Systema Natur&aelig;," and the inscription over the door of
his home at Hammarby was to Linn&aelig;us the wisdom of his
life. This inscription read: "Innocue vivito: Numen adest"
(Live blameless: God is here).</p>

<p>The followers of Linn&aelig;us are divided into two classes, explorers
and compilers. To the first class belonged his own students
and others who ransacked all lands for species to be added
to the lists of the "Systema Natur&aelig;." Those men, mostly
Scandinavian and Dutch, worked with wonderful zeal, enduring
every hardship and making great contributions to knowledge,
which they published in more or less satisfactory forms.
To these men we owe the beginnings of the science of geographical
distribution. Among the most notable of these are Pehr Osbeck
and Fredrik Hasselquist, already noted; Otto Fabricius (1744-1822),
author of an excellent "Fauna of Greenland"; Carl
Peter Thunberg (1743-), successor of Linn&aelig;us as rector of
the University of Upsala, who collected fishes about Nagasaki,
intrusting most of the descriptive work to the less skillful hands
of his students, Jonas Nicolas Ahl and Martin Houttuyn; Martin
Th. Br&uuml;nnich, who collected at Marseilles the materials for
his "Pisces Massiliensis"; Petrus Forsk&aring;l (1736-63), whose
work on the fishes of the Red Sea ("Descriptio Animalium,"
etc.), published posthumously in 1775, is one of the most accu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>rate
of faunal lists, and one which shows a fine feeling for taxonomic
distinctions scarcely traceable in any previous author.
Georg Wilhelm Steller (1709-45), naturalist of Bering's expedition,
gathered amid incredible hardships the first knowledge
of the fishes of Alaska and Siberia, his notes being printed after
his tragic death, by Pallas and Krascheninnikov. Petrus
Simon Pallas (1741-1811) gives the account of his travels in
the North Pacific in his most valuable volumes, "Zoographia
Russo-Asiatica"; Johann Georg Gmelin (1709-55) with Samuel
Theophilus Gmelin (1745-84), and Johann Anton G&uuml;ldenst&auml;dt
(1745-91), like Steller, crossed Siberia, recording its animals.
Johann David Sch&ouml;pf (1752-1800), a Hessian surgeon stationed
at Long Island in the Revolutionary War, gave an excellent
account of the fishes about New York.</p>

<p>Still other naturalists accompanied navigators around the
globe, collecting specimens and information as opportunity
offered. John Reinhold Forster (1729-98), with his son, John
George Adam Forster (1754-94), and Daniel Solander (1736-81),
a student of Linn&aelig;us, and Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820),
sailed with Captain James Cook. Philibert Commerson (1727-73)
accompanied the explorer, Louis Antoine de Bougainville,
and furnished nearly all the original material used by Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de.
Other noted travelers of the early days were Pierre
Sonnerat and Mungo Park.</p>

<p>Still other naturalists, scarcely less useful, gave detailed
accounts of the fauna of their own native regions. Ablest of
these was Anatole Risso, an apothecary of Nice, who published
in 1810 the "Ichthyologie de Nice," an excellent work, afterward
(1826) expanded by him into a "Histoire Naturelle de
l'Europe M&eacute;ridional&eacute;."</p>

<p>Contemporary with Risso was a man of very different character,
Constantine Samuel Rafinesque (1784-1842), who wrote
at Palermo in 1810 his "Caratteri di Alcuni Nuovi Generi"
and his "Ittiologia Siciliana." Later he went to America,
where he was for a time professor in the Transylvania University
at Lexington, Ky. Brilliant, erudite, irresponsible, fantastic,
he wrote of the fishes of Sicily and later ("Ichthyologia Ohiensis,"
1820) of the fishes of the Ohio River, with wide knowledge,
keen taxonomic insight, and a hopeless disregard of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
elementary principles of accuracy. Always eager for novelties,
restless and credulous, his writings have been among the most
difficult to interpret of any in ichthyology.</p>

<p>Earlier than Risso and Rafinesque, Thomas Pennant (1726-58)
wrote of the British fishes; Otto Fredrik M&uuml;ller of the
fishes of Denmark; J. E. Gunner, Bishop of Thr&ouml;ndhjem, of
fishes of Norway; Francis Valentijn (1660-1730), Jan Nieuhof
(1600-1671), Renard, and Castour of the fishes of the Dutch
East Indies; Duhamel du Monceau of the fisheries of France;
Francesco Cette of the fishes of Sicily; Jos&eacute; Cornide of the
fishes of Spain; Ignacio Molina of the fishes of Chile; and Meidinger
of those of Austria. Some of these writers lived before
Linn&aelig;us. Others knew little of the Linn&aelig;an system, and their
records are generally in the vernacular. Most important of
this class is the work of Antonio Parra, "Descripcion de Diferentes
Piezas de Historia Natural de la Isla de Cuba," published
in Havana in 1787. In 1803, Patrick Russell gave a valuable
account, non-binomial, of "Two Hundred Fishes Collected at
Vizagapatam and on the Coast of Coromandel."</p>

<p>Papers on the fishes of Bering Sea and Japan by Wilhelm
Theophilus Tilesius (1775-1835), are published in the transactions
of the early societies of Russia. The collections of
the traveler Krusenstern were recorded by Tilesius. Stephen
Krascheninnikov (1786) wrote a history of Russia in Asia.</p>

<p>Other notable names among the early writers are those of
Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet, of Montpelier, whose work
(1780), too soon cut short, showed marked promise; Fr. Faber,
who wrote of the fishes of Iceland; E. Blyth, who studied the
fishes of the Andamans; A. G. Desmarest, who made excellent
studies of the fishes of Cuba; J. T. K&ouml;lreuter and Everard
Home in the East Indies; Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire, who recorded
the fishes of Egypt at the command of Napoleon. Others
equally notable were B. A. Euphrasen, Iwan Lepechin (1750-1802),
John Latham, W. E. Leach, George Montagu, C. Quensel,
Jean-Antoine Scopoli, Peter Ascanius, Francois Etienne de
la Roche (1789-1812), Hans Str&ouml;m, M. Vahl and Zuieuw.</p>

<p>The compilers who followed Linn&aelig;us belonged to a wholly
different class. These were men of extensive learning, methodi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>cal
ways, sometimes brilliant, occasionally of deep insight, but
more often, on the whole, dull, plodding, and mechanical.</p>

<p>Earliest of those is Antoine Gouan, whose "Historia Piscium"
was published in Paris in 1770. In this work, which is of
fair quality, only genera were included, and the three new ones
which he introduces into the "System" (<i>Lepadogaster</i>, <i>Lepidopus</i>,
and <i>Trachypterus</i>) are still retained with his definition of
them.</p>

<p>Johann Friedrich Gmelin (1748-1804), a relative of the explorers
of Siberia, published in 1788 a thirteenth edition of the
"Systema Natur&aelig;" of Linn&aelig;us, adding to it the discoveries of
Forsk&aring;l, Forster, and others who had written since Linn&aelig;us'
time. This work was useful as bringing the compilation of
Linn&aelig;us to a later date, but it is not well done, the compiler
having little knowledge of the animals described and little penetration
in matters of taxonomy. Very similar in character,
although more lucid in expression, is the French compilation
of the same date (1788), "Tableau Encyclop&eacute;dique et M&eacute;thodique
des Trois R&egrave;gnes de la Nature," by the Abb&eacute; J. P. Bonnaterre.
Another volume of the "Encyclop&eacute;die M&eacute;thodique,"
of still less merit, was published as a dictionary in Paris in 1787
by R&eacute;n&eacute; Just Ha&uuml;y. Another dictionary in 1817 even poorer
was the work of Hippolyte Cloquet.</p>

<p>In 1792, Johann Julius Walbaum (1721-1800), a German
compiler of a little higher rank, gathered together the records
of all known species, using the work of Artedi as a basis and
giving binominal names in place of the vernacular terms used
by Sch&ouml;pf, Steller, Pennant, and Krascheninnikov.</p>

<p>Far more pretentious and more generally useful, as well as
containing a large amount of original material, is the "Ichthyologia"
of Mark Eliezer Bloch, published in Berlin in various
parts from 1782 to 1785. It was originally in German and
divided into two portions&mdash;"Oeconomische Naturgeschichte
der Fische Deutschlands" and "Naturgeschichte der auslandischen
Fische." Bloch was a Jewish physician, born at Anspach
in 1723, and at the age of fifty-six began to devote himself
to ichthyology. In his great work is contained every species
which he had himself seen, every one which he could purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
from collections, and every one of which he could find drawings
made by others.</p>

<p>That part which relates to the fishes of Germany is admirably
done. In the treatment of East Indian and American
fishes there is much guesswork and many errors of description
and of fact, for which the author was not directly responsible.
To learn to interpret the personal equation in the systematic
work of other men is one of the most delicate of taxonomic
arts.</p>

<p>After the publication of these great folio volumes of plates,
Dr. Bloch began a systematic catalogue to include all known
species. This was published after his death by his collaborator,
the philologist, Dr. Johann Gottlob Schneider. This work,
"M. E. Blochii Systema Ichthyologia," contains 1519 species
of fishes, and is the most creditable compilation subsequent to
the death of Linn&aelig;us.</p>

<p>Even more important than the work of Bloch is that of the
Comte de La C&eacute;p&egrave;de, who became with the progress of the
French Revolution, "Citoyen Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de," his original full name
being Bernard Germain Etienne de la Ville-sur-Illon, Comte
de La C&eacute;p&egrave;de. His great work, "Histoire Naturelle des Poissons,"
was published originally in five volumes, in Paris, from 1798
to 1803. It was brought out under great difficulties, his materials
being scattered, his country in a constant tumult. For
original material he depended largely on the collections and
sagacious notes of the traveler Commerson. Dr. Gill sums up
the strength and weakness of Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de's work in these terms:</p>

<p>"A work by an able man and eloquent writer even prone to
aid rhetoric by the aid of the imagination in absence of desirable
facts, but which because of undue confidence in others, default
of comparison of material from want thereof and otherwise,
and carelessness generally is entirely unreliable."</p>

<p>The work of Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de had a great influence upon subsequent
investigators, especially in France. A considerable number
of the numerous new genera of Rafinesque were founded
on divisions made in the analytical keys of Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1803 and 1804, Dr. George Shaw published in London
his "General Zoology," the fishes forming part of volumes IV
and V. This is a poor compilation, the part concerning the
fishes being mostly extracted from Bloch and Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de. Another
weak compilation for the supposed use of students was
the "Ichthyologie Analytique" of A. M. Constant Dum&eacute;ril.
About 1815, Henri Ducrotay de Blainville wrote the "Faune
Fran&ccedil;aise" and contributed important studies to the taxonomy
of sharks.</p>

<p>With Georges L&eacute;opold Chr&eacute;tien Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Dagobert Cuvier
(1769-1832) and the "R&egrave;gne Animal arrang&eacute; apr&eacute;s son Organization"
(1817; 1829-30) we have the beginning of a new era in
ichthyology. This period is characterized by a recognition of
the existence of a natural classification inevitable in proportion
to the exactness of our knowledge, because based on the principles
of morphology. The "R&egrave;gne Animal" is, in the history
of ichthyology, not less important than the "Systema Natur&aelig;"
itself, and from it dates practically our knowledge of families of
fishes and the interrelations of the different groups. The great
facts of homology were clearly understood by Cuvier. Their
significance as indications of lines of descent were never grasped
by him, and this notwithstanding the fact that Cuvier was
almost the first to bring extinct forms into proper relations with
those now living.</p>

<p>Dr. G&uuml;nther well says that the investigation of anatomy of
fishes was continued by Cuvier until he had succeeded in completing
so perfect a framework of the system of the whole class
that his immediate successors could content themselves with
filling up those details for which their master had no leisure.
Indefatigable in examining all the external and internal characters
of the fishes of a rich collection, he ascertained the natural
affinities of the infinite variety of fishes, and accurately defined
the divisions, orders, families, and genera of the class as they
appear in the two original editions of the "R&egrave;gne Animal."
His industry equaled his genius; he opened connections with
almost every accessible part of the globe; not only French travelers
and naturalists, but also Germans, Englishmen, Americans
rivaled one another to assist him with collections; and
for many years the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes was the
Center where all ichthyological treasures were deposited. Thus
Cuvier brought together a collection the like of which had never
been seen before, and which, as it contains all the materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
on which his labors were based, must still be considered to be
one of the most important in existence.</p>

<p>"Those little low rooms, five in number" (in the museum
of the Jardin des Plantes), "they should be the Mecca of scientific
devotees. Perhaps every great zoologist of the past hundred
years has sat in them and discussed those problems of
life which are always inviting solution and are never solved.
The spirits of great naturalists still haunt these corridors and
speak from the specimens their hands have set in order."
(<span class="smcap">Theodore Lyman.</span>)</p>

<p>Cuvier's studies of the different species of fishes are contained
in the great "Histoire Naturelle des Poissons," the joint
work of Cuvier and his pupil and successor, Achille Valenciennes
(1794-1865). Of this work 22 volumes were published,
from 1828 to 1849, containing 4514 nominal species, the
greater portion being written after the death of Cuvier (1832).
The work was finally left unfinished on account of a disagreement
with the publisher. Dr. Gill tells me that at this time
Valenciennes made an unsuccessful appeal to the Smithsonian
Institution for assistance in the publication of the remaining
chapters.</p>

<p>This is a most masterly work, indispensable to the student
of fishes. Its descriptions are generally fairly correct, its plates
accurate, and its judgments trustworthy. But with all this it
is very unequal. Too often nominal species are based on variations
due to age or sex or to the conditions of preservation of
specimens. Many of the species are treated very lightly by
Cuvier; many of the descriptions of Valenciennes are very
mechanical, as though the author had grown weary of the endless
process, "a failing commonly observed among zoologists
when attention to descriptive details becomes to them a tedious
task."</p>

<p>After the death of Valenciennes (1865) Dr. Auguste Dum&eacute;ril
began another Natural History of the Fishes. Of this
two volumes (1865-70) were published covering sharks, ganoids,
and other fishes not treated by Cuvier and Valenciennes, his
category beginning at the opposite end of the fish series. The
death of Dum&eacute;ril left this catalogue also unfinished. Dum&eacute;ril's
work is useful and carefully done, but his excessive trust in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
slight differences has filled his book with nominal species. Thus
among the living ganoid fishes he recognizes 135 species, the
actual number being not far from 40.</p>

<p>We may anticipate the sequence of time by here referring
to the remaining attempts at a record of all the fishes in the
world, Dr. Albert C. L. G. G&uuml;nther, a naturalist of German
birth, but resident in London for many years, long the honored
keeper of the British Museum, published in eight volumes the
"Catalogue of the Fishes of the British Museum," from 1859 to
1870. In this monumental work, the one work most essential
to all systematic study of fishes, 6843 species are described and
1682 doubtful species are mentioned. The book is a remarkable
example of patient industry. Its great merits are at once
apparent, and those of us engaged in the same line of study
may pass by its faults with the leniency which we may hope
that posterity may bestow on ours.</p>

<p>The publication of this work gave an immediate impetus to
the study of fishes. The number of known species has been
raised from 9000 to about 12,000 in the last thirty years, although
meanwhile some hundreds of species even accepted by the conservatism
of G&uuml;nther have been erased from the system.</p>

<p>A new edition of this work has been long in contemplation,
and in 1898 the first volume of it, covering the percoid fishes,
was published by Dr. George Albert Boulenger. This volume
is one of the most satisfactory in the history of ichthyology.
It is based on ample material. Its accepted species have been
subject to thorough criticism and in its classification every
use has been made of the teachings of morphology and especially
of osteology. Its classification is distinctly modern, and
with the writings of the contemporary ichthyologists of Europe
and America, it is fully representative of the scientific era
ushered in by the researches of Darwin. The chief criticism
which one may apply to this work concerns most of the publications
of the British Museum. It is the frequent assumption
that those species not found in the greatest museum of the
world do not really exist at all. There are still many forms
of life, very many, outside the series gathered in any or all
collections.</p>

<p>We may now turn from the universal catalogues to the
work on special groups, on local faunas, or on particular branches
of the subject of ichthyology. These lines of study were made
possible by the work of Cuvier and Valenciennes and especially
by that of Dr. G&uuml;nther.</p>

<p>Before taking up the students of faunal groups, we may,
out of chronological order, consider the researches of three
great taxonomists, who have greatly contributed to the modern
system of the classification of fishes.</p>

<p>Louis Agassiz (born at Motiers in western Switzerland in
1807; died at Cambridge, Mass., in 1873) was a man of wonderful
insight in zoological matters and possessed of a varied range
of scientific information, scarcely excelled in any age&mdash;intellectually
a lineal descendant of Aristotle. His first work on fishes
was the large folio on the fishes collected by Jean Baptiste Spix
(1781-1826) in Brazil, published at Munich in 1827. After
his establishment in America in 1846, soon after which date,
he became a professor in Harvard University, Agassiz published
a number of illuminating papers on the fresh-water fishes
of North America. He was the first to recognize the necessity
of the modern idea of genera among fishes, and most of the
groups designated by him as distinct genera are retained by
later writers. He was also the first to investigate the structure
of the singular viviparous surf-fishes of California, the names
<i>Embiotoca</i> and <i>Holconotus</i> applied to these fishes being chosen
by him.</p>

<p>His earlier work, "Recherches sur les Poissons des Eaux
Douces," published in Europe, gave a great impetus to our
knowledge of the anatomy and especially of the embryology
of the fresh-water fishes. Most important of all his zoological
publications was the "Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles,"
published at Neufchatel from 1833 to 1843. This work laid
the foundation of the systematic study of the extinct groups
of fishes. The relations of sharks were first appreciated by
Agassiz, and the first segregation of the ganoids was due to him.
Although he included in this group many forms not truly related
either to anything now called ganoids, nor even to the extinct
mailed forms which preceded them, yet the definition of this
order marked a distinct step in advance.</p>

<p>The great, genial, hopeful personality of Agassiz and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
remarkable skill as a teacher made him the "best friend that
ever student had" and gave him a large following as a teacher.
Among his pupils in ichthyology were Charles Girard (1822-1895),
Frederick Ward Putnam, Alexander Agassiz, Samuel
Garman, Samuel H. Scudder, and the present writer.</p>

<p>Johannes M&uuml;ller (1808-1858), of Berlin, was one of the
greatest of comparative anatomists. In his revision of Cuvier's
"System of Classification" he corrected many errors in grouping,
and laid foundations which later writers have not altered
or removed. Especially important is his classical work, "Ueber
den Bau and die Grenzen der Ganoiden." In this he showed
some of the real fundamental characters of that group of archaic
fishes, and took from it the most heterogeneous of the elements
left in it by Agassiz. To M&uuml;ller we also owe the first
proper definition of the Leptocardii and the Cyclostomata,
and, in association with Dr. J. Henle, M&uuml;ller has given us one of
the best general accounts of the sharks ("Systematische Beschriebungen
der Plagiostomen"). To M&uuml;ller we owe an accession
of knowledge in regard to the duct of the air-bladder, and
the groups called Physostomi, Physoclysti, Dipneusti (Dipnoi),
Pharyngognathi, and Anacanthini were first defined by him.</p>

<p>In his work on Devonian fishes, the great British comparative
anatomist, Thomas Henry Huxley, first distinguished
the group of Crossopterygians, and separated it from the ganoids
and dipnoans.</p>

<p>Theodore Nicholas Gill is the keenest interpreter of taxonomic
facts yet known in the history of ichthyology. He
is the author of a vast number of papers, the first bearing date
of 1858, touching almost every group and almost every phase
of relation among fishes. His numerous suggestions as to
classification have been usually accepted in time by other
authors, and no one has had a clearer perception than he of
the necessity of orderly methods in nomenclature. Among
the orders first defined by Gill are the Eventognathi, Nematognathi,
Pediculati, Iniomi, Heteromi, Haplomi, Xenomi, and
the group called Teleocephali, originally framed to include all
the bony fishes except those which showed peculiar eccentricities
or modifications. Dr. Gill's greatest excellence has been shown
as a scientific critic. Incisive, candid, and friendly, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
scarcely an investigator in biology, in America, who is not directly
indebted to him for critical aid of the highest importance. The
present writer cannot too strongly express his own obligations
to this great teacher, his master in fish taxonomy.
Dr. Gill's work is not centered in any single great treatise,
but is diffused through a very large number of brief papers
and catalogues, those from 1861 to 1865 mostly published
by the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, those
of recent date by the United States National Museum.
For many years Dr. Gill has been identified with the work
of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington.</p>

<p>Closely associated with Dr. Gill was Dr. Edward Drinker
Cope, of Philadelphia, a tireless worker in almost every field of
zoology, and a large contributor to the broader fields of ichthyological
taxonomy as well as to various branches of descriptive
zoology. Cope was one of the first to insist on the close
relation of the true ganoids with the teleost fishes, the nearest
related group of which he defined as Isospondyli. At the same
time he recognized the wide range of difference even among the
forms which Johannes M&uuml;ller had assembled under that name.
In breadth of vision and keenness of insight, Cope ranked with
the first of taxonomic writers. Always bold and original, he
was not at all times accurate in details, and to the final result
in classification his contribution has been less than that of Dr.
Gill. Professor Cope also wrote largely on American fresh-water
fishes, a large percentage of the Cyprinid&aelig; and Percid&aelig;
of the eastern United States having been discovered by him,
as well as much of the Rocky Mountain fauna. In later years
his attention was absorbed by the fossil forms, and most of
the species of Cretaceous rocks and the Eocene shales of Wyoming
were made known through his ceaseless activity.</p>

<p>The enumeration of other workers in the great field of
ichthyology must assume something of the form of a catalogue.
Part of the impulse received from the great works of
Cuvier and Valenciennes and of G&uuml;nther was spent in connection
with voyages of travel. In 1824 Quoy and Gaimard
published in Paris the great folio work on the fishes collected
by the corvette <i>l'Uranie</i> and <i>la Physicienne</i> in Freycinet's
voyages around the world, and in 1834 the same authors published
the fishes collected in Duperrey's voyage of the <i>Astrolabe</i>.
In 1826 Lesson published the fishes of Dumont D'Urville's
voyage of the <i>Coquille</i>. These three great works lie
at the foundation of our knowledge of the fishes of Polynesia.
In 1839 Eydoux and Gervais published an account of the fishes
of the voyage of <i>La Favorite</i>. In 1853, also in Paris, Hombron
and Jacquinot gave an account of the fishes taken in
Dumont D'Urville's expedition to the South Pole. In England,
Sir John Richardson (1787-1865), a wise and careful
naturalist, wrote of the fishes collected by the <i>Sulphur</i> (1845),
the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> (1846), the <i>Samarang</i>, and the <i>Herald</i>.
Lay and Bennett recorded the species taken by Beechey's
voyage on the <i>Blossom</i>. A most useful work is the account
of the species taken by Charles Darwin on the voyage of the
<i>Beagle</i>, prepared by the conscientious hand of Rev. Leonard
Jenyns. Still more important and far ranging is the voyage
of the <i>Challenger</i>, including the first important work in the deep
seas, one stately volume and parts of other volumes on fishes
being the work of Dr. G&uuml;nther. Other deep-sea work of equal
importance has been accomplished in the Atlantic and the
Pacific by the U. S. Fish Commission steamer <i>Albatross</i>. Its
results in Central America, Alaska, Japan, Hawaii, as well as
off both coasts of the United States, have been made known
in different memoirs by Goode and Bean, Gilbert, Garman,
Gill, Jordan, Cramer, Ryder, and others. The deep-sea fish
collections of the <i>Fish Hawk</i> and the <i>Blake</i> have been studied
by Goode and Bean and Garman.</p>

<p>The deep-sea work of other countries may be briefly
noticed. The French vessels <i>Travailleur</i> and <i>Talisman</i> have
made collections chiefly in the Mediterranean and along the
coast of Africa, the results having been made known by L&eacute;on
Valliant. The <i>Hirondelle</i> about the Azores and elsewhere
has furnished material for Professor Robert Collett, of the
University of Christiania. Dr. Decio Vinciguerra, of Rome,
has reported on the collections of the <i>Violante</i>, a vessel belonging
to the Prince of Monaco. Dr. A. Alcock, of Calcutta, has
had charge of the most valuable deep-sea work of the <i>Investigator</i>
in the Indian Seas. Edgar R. Waite and James
Douglas Ogilby, of the Australian Museum at Sydney, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
described the collections of the <i>Thetis</i>, on the shores of the
New South Wales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>

<p>From Austria the voyage of the frigate <i>Novara</i> has yielded
large material which has been described by Dr. Rudolph Kner.
The cream of many voyages of many Danish merchant vessels
has been gathered in the "Spolia Atlantica" and other truly
classical papers of Christian Frederik L&uuml;tken, of the University
of Copenhagen, one of the most accomplished naturalists
of recent times.</p>

<p>F. H. von Kittlitz has written on the fishes seen by him
in the northern Pacific, and earlier and more important we may
mention the many ichthyological notes found in the records
of travel in Mexico and South America by Alexander von
Humboldt (1796-1859).</p>

<p>The local faunal work in various nations has been very
extensive. In Great Britain we may note Parnell's "Natural
History of the Fishes of the Firth of Forth," published in Edinburgh
in 1838, William Yarrell's "History of British Fishes"
(1859), the earlier histories of British fishes by Edward Donovan
and by William Turton, and the works of J. Couch (1862)
and Dr. Francis Day (1888), possessing similar titles. The
work of Day, with its excellent plates, will long be the standard
account of the relatively scant fish fauna of the British islands.
H. G. Seeley has prepared (1886) also a useful synopsis of
"The Fresh-water Fishes of Europe."</p>

<p>We may here notice without praise the pretentious work
of William Swainson (1838-39). W. Thompson has written
of the fishes of Ireland, and Rev. Richard T. Lowe and J. Y.
Johnson have done most excellent work on the fishes of
Madeira. F. McCoy, better known for work on fossil fishes,
may be mentioned here.</p>

<p>The fish fauna of Scandinavia has been described more or
less fully by S. Kr&ouml;yer (1840), Robert Nilsson (1855), Fries
and Ekstr&ouml;m (1836), Robert Collett, Robert Lilljeborg, and
F. A. Smitt, besides special papers by other writers, notably
Reinhardt, L. Esmarck, Japetus Steenstrup, L&uuml;tken, and A.
W. Malm. Reinhardt, Kr&ouml;yer, L&uuml;tken, and A. J. Malmgren
have written of the Arctic fishes of Greenland and Spitzbergen.</p>

<p>In Russia, Nordmann has described the fishes of the Black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
Sea ("Ichthyologic Pontique," Paris, 1840) and Eichwald those
of the Caspian. More recently, S. Herzenstein, Warpachowsky,
K. Kessler, B. N. Dybowsky, and others have written
of the rich fauna of Siberia, the Caucasus, and the scarcely
known sea of Ochotsk. Stephan Basilevsky has written of the
fishes of northern China. A. Kowalevsky has contributed
very much to our knowledge of anatomy. Peter Schmidt
has studied the fishes of the Japan Sea.</p>

<p>In Germany and Austria the chief local works have been
those of Heckel and Kner on the fresh-water fishes of Austria
(1858) and C. Th. von Siebold on the fresh-water fishes of
Central Europe (1863). German ichthyologists have, however,
often extended their view to foreign regions where their characteristic
thoroughness and accuracy has made their work illuminating.
The two memoirs of Eduard R&uuml;ppell on the fishes
of the Red Sea and the neighboring parts of Africa, "Atlas zu
der Reise im N&ouml;rdlichen Afrika," 1828, and "Neue Wirbelthiere,"
1837, rank with the very best of descriptive literature.
G&uuml;nther's illustrated "Fische der S&uuml;dsee," published in Hamburg,
may be regarded as German work. The excellent colored
plates are mostly from the hand of Andrew Garrett. Other
papers are those of Dr. Wilhelm Peters on Asiatic fishes, the
most important being on the fishes of Mozambique. J. J.
Heckel, Rudolph Kner, and Franz Steindachner, successively
directors of the Museum at Vienna, have written largely on
fishes. The papers of Steindachner cover almost every part
of the earth and are absolutely essential to any systematic
study of fishes. No naturalist of any land has surpassed Steindachner
in industry or accuracy, and his work has the advantage
of the best illustrations of fishes made by any artist, the
noted Eduard Konopicky. In association with Dr. D&ouml;derlein,
formerly of Tokyo, Dr. Steindachner has given an excellent
account of the fishes of Japan. Other German writers
are J. J. Kaup, who has worked in numerous fields, but as a
whole with little skill, Dr. S. B. Klunzinger, who has given
excellent accounts of the fishes of the Red Sea, and Dr. Franz
Hilgendorf, of the University of Berlin, whose papers on the
fishes of Japan and other regions have shown a high grade of
taxonomic insight. A writer of earlier date is W. L. von Rapp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
who wrote on the "Fische den Bodensees." J. F. Brandt has
written of the sturgeons of Russia, and Johann Marcusen, to
whom we owe much of our knowledge, of the Mormyri of Africa.</p>

<p>In Italy, Charles Lucien Bonaparte, Prince of Canino, has
published an elaborate "Fauna Italica" (1838) and in numerous
minor papers has taken a large part in the development of
ichthyology. Many of the accepted names of the large groups
(as Elasmobranchii, Heterosomata, etc.) were first suggested
by Bonaparte. The work of Rafinesque has been already
noticed. O. G. Costa published (about 1850) a "Fauna of
Naples." In recent times Camillo Ranzani, of Bologna, wrote
on the fishes of Brazil and of the Mediterranean. Giovanni
Canestrini, Decio Vinciguerra, Enrico Hillyer Giglioli, Luigi
D&ouml;derlein, and others have contributed largely to our knowledge
of Italian fishes, while Carlo F. Emery, F. de Filippi, Luigi
Facciol&aacute;, and others have studied the larval growth of different
species. Camillo Ranzani, G. G. Bianconi, Domenico Nardo,
Cristoforo Bellotti, Alberto Perugia, and others have contributed
to different fields of ichthyology.</p>

<p>Nicholas Apostolides and, still later, Horace A. Hoffman
and the present writer, have written of the fishes of Greece.</p>

<p>In France, the fresh-water fishes are the subject of an important
work by Emile Blanchard (1866), and Emile Moreau has
given us a convenient account of the fish fauna of France.
L&eacute;on Vaillant has written on various groups of fishes, his
monograph of the American darters (Etheostomin&aelig;) being a
masterpiece so far as the results of the study of relatively scanty
material would permit. The "Mission Scientifique au Mexique,"
by Valliant and F. Bocourt, is one of the most valuable
contributions to our knowledge of the fishes of that region. Dr.
H. E. Sauvage, of Boulogne-sur-Mer, has also written largely
on the fishes of Asia, Africa, and other regions. Among the
most important of these are the "Poissons de Madagascar,"
and a monograph of the sticklebacks. Alexander Thominot
and Jacques Pellegrin have also written, in the Museum of the
Jardin des Plantes, on different groups of fishes. Earlier
writers were Constant Dum&eacute;ril, Alphonse Guichenot, L. Brissot
de Barneville, H. Hollard, an able anatomist, and Bibron,
an associate of Auguste Dum&eacute;ril.</p>

<p>In Spain and Portugal the chief work of local authors is
that of J. V. B. Bocage and F. de Brito Capello on the fishes of
Portugal. So far as the fishes of Spain are concerned, the most
valuable memoir is Steindachner's account of his travels in
Spain and Portugal. The principal studies of the Balkan region
have also been made by Steindachner. Jos&eacute; Gogorza y Gonz&aacute;lez,
of the Museum of Madrid, has given a list of the fishes
of the Philippines. A still more elaborate list, praiseworthy as
a beginning, is the work of the Reverend Padre Casto de
Elera, professor of Natural History in the Dominican College
of Santo Tomas in Manila.</p>

<p>In Holland, the chief great works have been those of Schlegel
and Pieter van Bleeker. Professor H. Schlegel, of the University
of Leyden, described the fishes collected about Nagasaki by
Ph. Fr. de Siebold and B&uuml;rger. His work on fishes forms a
large folio illustrated by colored plates, a volume of the "Fauna
Japonica," published in Leyden from 1843 to 1847. Schlegel's
work in every field is characterized by scrupulous care and
healthful conservatism, and the "Fauna Japonica" is a most
useful monument to his rare powers of discrimination.</p>

<p>Pieter von Bleeker (1819-78), a surgeon in the Dutch
East Indies, is the most voluminous writer in ichthyology.
He began his work in Java without previous training and in a
very rich field where almost everything was new. With many
mistakes at first he rose to the front by sheer force of industry
and patience, and his later work, while showing much of the
"personal equation," is still thoroughly admirable. At his
death he was engaged in the publication of a magnificent folio
work, "Atlas Ichthyologique des Indes Orientales Neerlandaises,"
illustrated by colored plates. This work remains
about two-thirds completed. The writings of Dr. Bleeker
constitute the chief source of our knowledge of the fauna of the
East Indies.</p>

<p>Dr. Van Lidth de Jeude, of the University of Leyden, is
the author of a few descriptive papers on fishes.</p>

<p>To Belgium we may assign part at least of the work of
the eminent Belgian naturalist, George Albert Boulenger, now
long connected with the British Museum. His various valuable
papers on the fishes of the Congo are published under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
auspices of the "Congo Free State." To Belgium also we may
ascribe the work of Louis Dollo on the morphology of fishes
and on the deep-sea fishes obtained by the "Expedition Antarctique
Belge."</p>

<p>The fish fauna of Cuba has been the lifelong study of Dr.
Felipe Poey y Aloy (1799-1891), a pupil of Cuvier, for a half
century or more the honored professor of zoology in the University
of Havana. Of his many useful papers, the most extensive
are his "Memorias sobre la Historia Natural de la Isla de
Cuba," followed by a "Repertorio" and an "Enumeratio" in
which the fishes are elaborately catalogued. Poey devoted
himself solely to the rich fish fauna of his native island, in which
region he was justly recognized as a ripe scholar and a broad-minded
gentleman. A favorite expression of his was "Comme
naturaliste, je ne suis pas espagnol: je suis cosmopolite."
Before Poey, Guichenot, of Paris, had written on the fishes
collected in Cuba by Ramon de la Sagra (1810-60). His
account was published in Sagra's "Historia de Cuba," and later
Philip H. Gosse (1810-1888) wrote on the fishes of Jamaica.
Much earlier, Robert Hermann Schomburgk (1804-65) wrote
on the fishes of British Guiana. Other papers on the Caribbean
fishes were contributed by Johannes M&uuml;ller and F. H.
Troschel, and by Richard Hill and J. Hancock.</p>

<p>Besides the work in South America of Marcgraf, Agassiz,
Reinhardt, L&uuml;tken, Steindachner, Jenyns, Boulenger, and
others already named, we may note the local studies of Dr.
Carlos Berg in Argentina, Dr. R. A. Philippi, and Frederico
T. Delfin in Chile, Miranda-Ribeiro in Brazil, with Garman,
J. F. Abbott, and others in recent times. Carl H. Eigenmann
and earlier Jordan and Eigenmann have studied the great collections
made in Brazil by Agassiz. Steindachner has described
the collections of Johann Natterer and Gilbert those
made by Dr. John Casper Branner. The most recent examinations
of the myriads of Brazilian river fishes have been made
by Dr. Eigenmann. Earlier than any of these (1855), Francis
de Castelnau (1800-65) described many Brazilian fishes and
afterwards numerous fishes of Australia and southern Africa,
Alphonse Guichenot, of Paris, contributed a chapter on fishes
to Claude Gay's (1800-63) "History of Chile," and J. J. von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
Tschudi, of St. Gallen, published an elaborate but uncritical
"Fauna Peruana" with colored plates of Peruvian fishes.</p>

<p>In New Zealand, F. W. Hutton and J. Hector have published
a valuable work on the fishes of New Zealand, to which
Dr. Gill added useful critical notes in a study of "Antipodal
Faunas." Later writers have given us a good knowledge of
the fishes of Australia. Notable among them are Charles DeVis,
William Macleay, H. de Miklouho-Maclay, James Douglas
Ogilby, and Edgar R. Waite. Clarke has also written on
"Fishes of New Zealand."</p>

<p>The most valuable work on the fishes of Hindustan is the
elaborate treatise on the "Fishes of India" by Surgeon Francis
Day. In this all the species are figured, the groups being
arranged as in G&uuml;nther's catalogue, a sequence which few non-British
naturalists seem inclined to follow. Cantor's "Malayan
Fishes" is a memoir of high merit, as is also McClelland's work
on Indian fishes and the still earlier work of Francis Buchanan
Hamilton on the fishes of the Ganges. We may here refer to
Andrew Smith's papers on the fishes of the Cape of Good Hope
and to R. I. Playfair and A. G&uuml;nther's "Fishes of Zanzibar."
T. C. Jerdon, John Edward Gray, E. Tyrwhitt Bennett, and
others have also written on the fishes of India; J. C. Bennett
has published several excellent papers on the fishes of Polynesia
and the East Indies.</p>

<p>In Japan, following the scattering papers of Thunberg,
Tilesius, and Houttuyn, and the monumental work of Schlegel,
numerous species have been recorded by James Carson Brevoort,
G&uuml;nther, Gill, Eduard Nystr&ouml;m, Hilgendorf, and others.
About 1884 Steindachner and D&ouml;derlein published the valuable
"Fische Japans," based on the collections made about
Tokyo by Dr. D&ouml;derlein. In 1881, Motokichi Namiye, then
assistant curator in the Imperial University, published the
first list of Japanese fishes by a native author. In 1900, Dr.
Chiyomatsu Ishikawa, on the "Fishes of Lake Biwa," was the
first Japanese author to venture to name a new species of fish
(<i>Pseudogobio zezera</i>). This reticence was due not wholly to
lack of self-confidence, but rather to the scattered condition
of the literature of Japanese ichthyology. For this reason
no Japanese author has ever felt that any given undetermined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
species was really new. Other Japanese ichthyologists of
promise are Dr. Kamakichi Kishinouye, in charge of the Imperial
fisheries Bureau, Dr. Shinnosuke Matsubara, director of the
Imperial Fisheries Institute, Keinosuke Otaki, S. Hatta, S.
Nozawa, T. Kitahara, and Michitaro Sindo, and we may look for
others among the pupils of Dr. Kakichi Mitsukuri, the distinguished
professor of zoology in the Imperial University.</p>

<p>The most recent, as well as the most extensive, studies of
the fishes of Japan were made in 1999 by the present writer
and his associate, John Otterbein Snyder.</p>

<p>The scanty pre-Cuvieran work on the fishes of North
America has been already noticed. Contemporary with the
early work of Cuvier is the worthy attempt of Professor Samuel
Latham Mitchill (1764-1831) to record in systematic fashion
the fishes of New York. Soon after followed the admirable
work of Charles Alexandre Le Sueur (1789-1840), artist and
naturalist, who was the first to study the fishes of the Great
Lakes and the basin of the Ohio. Le Sueur's engravings of
fishes, in the early publications of the Academy of Natural
Sciences in Philadelphia, are still among the most satisfactory
representations of the species to which they refer. Constantine
Samuel Rafinesque (1784-1842), the third of this remarkable
but very dissimilar trio, published numerous papers descriptive
of the species he had seen or heard of in his various botanical
rambles. This culminated in his elaborate but untrustworthy
"Ichthyologia Ohiensis." The fishes of Ohio received
later a far more conscientious though less brilliant treatment
at the hands of Dr. Jared Potter Kirtland (1793-1877), an
eminent physician of Cleveland, Ohio. In 1842 the amiable
and scholarly James Ellsworth Dekay (1799-1851) published
his detailed report on the fishes of the "New York Fauna," and
a little earlier (1836) in the "Fauna Boreali-Americana" Sir
John Richardson (1787-1865) gave a most valuable and accurate
account of the fishes of the Great Lakes and Canada. Almost
simultaneously, Rev. Zadock Thompson (1796-1856) gave a
catalogue of the fishes of Vermont, and David Humphreys
Storer (1804-91) began his work on the fishes of Massachusetts,
finally expanded into a "Synopsis of the Fishes of North
America" (1846) and a "History of the Fishes of Massachu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>setts"
(1853-67). Dr. John Edwards Holbrook (1794-1871),
of Charleston, published (1855-60) his invaluable record of
the fishes of South Carolina, the promise of still more important
work, which was prevented by the outbreak of the Civil
War in the United States. The monograph on Lake Superior
(1850) and other publications of Louis Agassiz (1807-73)
have been already noticed. One of the first of Agassiz's students
was Charles Girard (1822-95), who came with him
from Switzerland, and, in association with Spencer Fullerton
Baird (1823-87), described the fishes from the United States
Pacific Railway Surveys (1858) and the United States and
Mexican Boundary Surveys (1859). Professor Baird, primarily
an ornithologist, became occupied with executive matters,
leaving Girard to finish these studies of the fishes. A
large part of the work on fishes published by the United States
National Museum and the United States Fish Commission has
been made possible through the direct help and inspiration of
Professor Baird. Among those engaged in this work, James
William Milner (1841-80), Marshall Macdonald (1836-95), and
Hugh M. Smith may be noted.</p>

<p>Most eminent, however, among the students and assistants
of Professor Baird was his successor, George Brown Goode
(1851-96), one of the most accomplished of American naturalists,
whose greatest work, "Oceanic Ichthyology," published
in collaboration with his long associate, Dr. Tarleton
Hoffman Bean, was barely finished at the time of his death.
The work of Theodore Nicholas Gill and Edward Drinker Cope
has been already noticed.</p>

<p>Other faunal writers of more or less prominence were William
Dandridge Peck (1763-1822) in New Hampshire, George Suckley
(1830-69) in Oregon, James William Milner (1841-80) in
the Great Lake Region, Samuel Stehman Haldeman (1812-80)
in Pennsylvania, William O. Ayres (1817-91) in Connecticut
and California; Dr. John G. Cooper (died 1902), Dr. William
P. Gibbons and Dr. William N. Lockington (died 1902)
in California; Philo Romayne Hoy (1816-93) studied the fishes
of Wisconsin, Charles Conrad Abbott those of New Jersey,
Silas Stearns (1859-88) those of Florida, Stephen Alfred Forbes
and Edward W. Nelson those of Illinois, Oliver Perry Hay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
later known for his work on fossil forms, those of Mississippi,
Alfredo Dug&eacute;s, of Guanajuato, those of Central Mexico.</p>

<p>Samuel Garman, at Harvard University, a student of
Agassiz, is the author of numerous valuable papers, the most
notable being on the sharks and on the deep-sea collections
of the <i>Albatross</i> in the Galapagos region, the last illustrated
by plates of most notable excellence. Other important monographs
of Garman treat of the Cyprinodonts and the Discoboli.</p>

<p>The present writer began a "Systematic Catalogue of the
Fishes of North America" in 1875 in association with his gifted
friend, Herbert Edson Copeland (1849-76), whose sudden
death, after a few promising beginnings, cut short the undertaking.
Later, Charles Henry Gilbert (1860-), a student of
Professor Copeland, took up the work and in 1883 a "Synopsis
of the Fishes of North America" was completed by Jordan
and Gilbert. Later, Dr. Gilbert has been engaged in studies
of the fishes of Panama, Alaska, and other regions, and the
second and enlarged edition of the "Synopsis" was completed
in 1898, as the "Fishes of North and Middle America," in collaboration
with another of the writer's students, Dr. Barton
Warren Evermann. A monographic review of the Fishes of
Puerto Rico was later (1900) completed by Dr. Evermann,
together with numerous minor works. Other naturalists whom
the writer may be proud to claim as students are Charles
Leslie McKay (1854-83), drowned in Bristol Bay, Alaska, while
engaged in explorations, and Charles Henry Bollman (1868-89),
stricken with fever in the Okefinokee Swamps in Georgia.
Still others are Dr. Carl B. Eigenmann, the indefatigable
investigator of Brazilian fishes and of the blind fishes of the
caves; Dr. Oliver Peebles Jenkins, the first thorough explorer
of the fishes of Hawaii; Dr. Alembert Winthrop Brayton,
explorer of the streams of the Great Smoky Mountains; Dr.
Seth Eugene Meek, explorer of Mexico; John Otterbein Snyder,
explorer of Mexico, Japan, and Hawaii; Edwin Chapin Starks,
explorer of Puget Sound and Panama and investigator of fish
osteology. Still other naturalists of the coming generation,
students of the present writer and of his lifelong associate,
Professor Gilbert, have contributed in various degrees to the
present fabric of American ichthyology. Among them are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
Mrs. Rosa Smith Eigenmann, Dr. Joseph Swain, Wilbur Wilson
Thoburn (1859-99), Frank Cramer, Alvin Seale, Albert Jefferson
Woolman, Philip H. Kirsch (1860-1902), Cloudsley Rutter
(died 1903), Robert Edward Snodgrass, James Francis Abbott,
Arthur White Greeley, Edmund Heller, Henry Weed Fowler,
Keinosuke Otaki, Michitaro Sindo, and Richard Crittenden
McGregor.</p>

an incident rather than a matter of central importance.</p>

<p><b>The Fossil Fishes.</b><a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>&mdash;The study of fossil fishes was begun systematically
during the first decades of the nineteenth century,
for it was then realized that of fossils of back-boned animals,
fishes were the only ones which could be determined from early
Pal&aelig;ozoic to recent horizons, and that from the diversity of
their forms they could serve as reliable indications of the age
of rocks. At a later time, when the evolution of vertebrates
began to be studied, fishes were examined with especial care
with a view of determining the ancestral line of the Amphibians.
The earliest work upon fossil fishes is, as one would naturally
expect, of a purely systematic value. Anatomical observations
were scanty and crude, but as the material for study
increased, a more satisfactory knowledge was gained of the
structures of the various major groups of fishes; and finally
by a comparison of anatomical results important light came
to be thrown upon more fundamental problems.</p>

<p>The study of fossil fishes can be divided for convenience
into three periods: (I) That which terminated in the <i>magnum
opus</i> of Louis Agassiz; (II) that of the systematists whose
major works appeared between 1845 and the recent publication
of the Catalogue of Fossil Fishes of the British Museum
(from this period date many important anatomical observations);
and (III) that of morphological work, roughly from
1870 to the present. During this period detailed consideration
has been given to the phylogeny of special structures,
to the probable lines of descent of the groups of fossil fishes,
and to the relationships of terrestrial to aquatic vertebrates.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p>
<p><b>First Period.</b>&mdash;<b>The Work of Louis Agassiz.</b>&mdash;The real beginning
of our knowledge of fossil fishes dates from the publication
of the classic volumes of Agassiz, "Recherches sur les Poissons
Fossiles (Neuch&acirc;tel, 1833-44)." There had previously existed
but a fragmentary and widely scattered literature; the time
was ripe for a great work which should bring together a
knowledge of this important vertebrate fauna and the museums
throughout Europe had been steadily growing in their
collections of fossils. Especially ripe, too, since the work of
Cuvier (1769-1832) had been completed and the classic anatomical
papers of J. M&uuml;ller (1802-56) were appearing. And
Agassiz (1807-73) was eminently the man for this mission.
At the age of one and twenty he had already mapped out the
work, and from this time he devoted sixteen active years to
its accomplishment. One gets but a just idea of the personality
of Agassiz when he recalls that the young investigator
while in an almost penniless position contrived to travel over
a large part of Europe, mingle with the best people of his day,
devote almost his entire time to research, employ draughtsmen
and lithographers, support his own printing-house, and in
the end publish his "Poissons Fossiles" in a fashion which would
have done credit to the wealthiest amateur. With tireless
energy he collected voluminous notes and drawings numberless;
he corresponded with collectors all over Europe and
prevailed upon them to loan him tons of specimens; in the
meanwhile he collated industriously the early but fragmental
literature in such works as those of de Blainville, M&uuml;nster,
Murchison, Buckland, Egerton, Redfield, W. C. Williamson,
and others. Hitherto less than 300 species of fossil fishes were
known; at the end of Agassiz's work about 900 were described
and many of them figured.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that such a work made a ready basis of
future studies. Doubtless, too, much is owing to the personal
energy of Agassiz that such keen interest was focused in the
collection and study of fossil fishes during the middle of the
nineteenth century. The actual value of Agassiz's work can
hardly be overestimated; his figures and descriptions are usually
clear and accurate. And it is remarkable, perhaps, that
in view of the very wide field which he covered that his errors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
are not more glaring and numerous. Upon the purely scientific
side, however, one must confess that the "Poissons Fossiles"
is of minor importance for the reason that as time has gone by
it has been found to yield no generalizations of fundamental
value. The classification of fishes advocated by Agassiz, based
upon the nature of the scales, has been shown to be convenient
rather than morphological. This indeed Agassiz himself appears
to realize in a letter written to Humboldt, but on the
other hand he regards his creation of the now discarded order
of <i>Ganoids</i>, which was based upon integumental characters,
as his most important contribution to the general study of
ichthyology. And although there passed through his hands
a series of forms more complete than has perhaps been seen
by any later ichthyologist,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> a series which demonstrates the steps
in the evolution of the various families and even orders of fishes,
he is nowhere led to such important philosophical conclusions
as was, for example, his contemporary, Johannes M&uuml;ller. And
even to his last day, in spite of the light which pal&aelig;ontology
must have given him, he denied strenuously the truth of the
doctrine of evolution, a result the more remarkable since he has
even given in graphic form the geological occurrence of the various
groups of fishes in a way which suggests closely a modern
phylogenetic table, and since at various times he has emphasized
the dictum that the history of the individual is but the
epitomized history of the race. The latter statement, which
has been commonly attributed to Agassiz, is clearly of much
earlier origin; it was definitely formulated by von Baer and
Meckel, the former of whom even as early as 1834 pronounced
himself a distinct evolutionist.</p>

<p><b>Second Period.</b>&mdash;<b>Systematic Study of Fossil Fishes.</b>&mdash;On the
ground planted by Agassiz, many important works sprang
up within the next decades. In England a vigorous school
of pal&aelig;ichthyologists was soon flourishing. Many papers
of Egerton date from this time, and the important work of
Owen on the structure of fossil teeth and the often-quoted
papers of Huxley in the "British Fossil Remains." Among
other workers may be mentioned James Powrie, author of a
number of papers upon Scottish Devonian fossils; the enthusiastic
Hugh Miller, stone-mason and geologist; Montague Brown,
Thomas Atthey, J. Young, and W. J. Barkas, students upon
Coal Measure fishes; E. Ray Lankester, some of whose early
papers deal with pteraspids; E. T. Newton, author of important
works on chim&aelig;roids. The extensive works of J. W. Davis
deal with fishes of many groups and many horizons. Mr.
Davis, like Sir Philip Gray Egerton, was an amateur whose
devotion did much to advance the study of fossil fishes. The
dean of British pal&aelig;ichthyology is at present Dr. R. H. Traquair,
of the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Arts. During
four decades he has devoted himself to his studies with rare
energy and success, author of a host of shorter papers and
numerous memoirs and reports. Finally, and belonging to a
younger generation of pal&aelig;ontologists, is to be named Arthur
Smith Woodward, curator of vertebrate pal&aelig;ontology of the
British Museum. Dr. Woodward has already contributed
many scores of papers to pal&aelig;ichthyology, besides publishing
a four-volume Catalogue of the Fossil Fishes of the British
Museum, a compendial work whose value can only be appreciated
adequately by specialists.</p>

<p>In the United States the study of fossil fishes was taken
up by J. H. and W. C. Redfield, father and son, prior to the
work of Agassiz, and there has been since that time an active
school of American workers. Agassiz himself, however, is
not to be included in this list, since his interest in extinct fishes
became almost entirely unproductive during his life in America.
Foremost among these workers was John Strong Newberry
(1822-92), of Columbia College, whose publications deal
with fishes of many horizons and whose work upon this continent
is not unlike that of Agassiz in Europe. He was the author
of many state reports, separate contributions, and two monographs,
one upon the pal&aelig;ozoic fishes of North America, the
other upon the Triassic fishes. Among the earlier pal&aelig;ontologists
were Orestes H. St. John, a pupil of Agassiz at Harvard,
and A. H. Worthen (1813-88), director of the Geological Survey
of Illinois; also W. Gibbes and Joseph Leidy. The late
E. D. Cope (1840-97) devoted a considerable portion of his
labors to the study of extinct fishes. E. W. Claypole, of Buchtel
College, is next to be mentioned as having produced note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>worthy
contributions to our knowledge of sharks, pal&aelig;aspids,
and arthrodires, as has also A. A. Wright, of Oberlin College.
Among other workers may be mentioned O. P. Hay, of the
American Museum; C. R. Eastman, of Harvard, author of
important memoirs upon arthrodires and other forms; Alban
Stewart, a student of Dr. S. W. Williston at Kansas University,
and Bashford Dean. Among Canadian pal&aelig;ontologists
G. F. Matthew deserves mention for his work on Cyathaspis,
Principal Dawson for interesting references to Mesozoic fishes,
and J. F. Whiteaves for his studies upon the Devonian fishes
of Scaumenac Bay.</p>

<p>Belgian pal&aelig;ontologists have also been active in their study
of fishes. Here we may refer to the work of Louis Dollo, of
Brussels, of Max Lohest, of P. J. van Beneden, of L. G. de
Koninck, of T. C. Winckler, and of R. Storms, the last of whom
has done interesting work on Tertiary fishes.</p>

<p>Foremost among Russian pal&aelig;ichthyologists is to be named
C. H. Pander, long-time Academician in St. Petersburg, whose
elaborate studies of extinct lung-fishes, ostracophores, and
crossopterygians published between 1856 and 1860 will long
stand as models of careful work. We should also refer to the
work of H. Asmuss and H. Trautschold, E. Eichwald and of
Victor Rohon, the last named having published many important
papers upon ostracophores during his residence in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>German pal&aelig;ichthyologists include Otto Jaekel, of Berlin;
O. M. Reis of the Oberbergamt, in Munich; A. von Koenen, of
G&ouml;ttingen; A. Wagner, E. Koken, and K. von Zittel. Among
Austro-Hungarians are Anton Fritsch, author of the <i>Fauna
der Gaskohleformations Boemens</i>; Rudolf Kner, an active student
of living fishes as well, as is also Franz Steindachner.</p>

<p>French pal&aelig;ichthyologists are represented by the veteran
H. E. Sauvage, of Boulogne-sur-Mer, V. Tholli&egrave;re, M. Brongniart,
and F. Priem. In Italy Francesco Bassani, of Naples,
is the author of many important works dealing with Mesozoic
and Tertiary forms; also was Baron Achille di Zigno. Robert
Collett, of Bergen, and G. Lindstr&ouml;m are worthy representatives
of Scandinavia in kindred work.</p>

<p><b>Third Period.</b>&mdash;<b>Morphological Work on Fossil Fishes.</b>&mdash;Among
the writers who have dealt with the problems of the rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>tionships
of the Ostracophores as well as <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> and
the Arthrodires may be named Traquair, Huxley, Newberry,
Smith Woodward, Rohon, Eastman, and Dean; most
recently William Patten. Upon the phylogeny of the sharks
Traquair, A. Fritsch, Hasse, Cope, Brongniart, Jaekel, Reis,
Eastman, and Dean. On Chim&aelig;roid morphology mention
may be made of the papers of A. S. Woodward, Reis, Jaekel,
Eastman, C. D. Walcott, and Dean. As to Dipnoan relationships
the paper of Louis Dollo is easily of the first value; of
especial interest, too, is the work of Eastman as to the early
derivation of the Dipnoan dentition. In this regard a paper
of Rohon is noteworthy, as is also that of Richard Semon on
the development of the dentition of recent Neoceratodus, since
it contains a number of references to extinct types. Interest
notes on Dipnoan fin characters have been given by Traquair.
In the morphology of Ganoids, the work of Traquair and A. S.
Woodward takes easily the foremost rank. Other important
works are those of Huxley, Cope, A. Fritsch, and Oliver P.
Hay.</p>

<p><b>Anatomists.</b>&mdash;Still more difficult of enumeration is the long
list of those who have studied the anatomy of fishes usually
in connection with the comparative anatomy or development
of other animals. Pre-eminent among these are Karl Ernst
von Baer, Cuvier, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Louis Agassiz, Johannes
M&uuml;ller, Carl Vogt, Carl Gegenbaur, William Kitchen Parker,
Francis M. Balfour, Thomas Henry Huxley, Meckel, H. Rathke,
Richard Owen, Kowalevsky, H. Stannius, Joseph Hyrtl, Gill,
Boulenger, and Bashford Dean. Other names of high authority
are those of Wilhelm His, K&ouml;lliker, Bakker, Rosenthal, Gottsche,
Miklucho-Macleay, Weber, Hasse, Retzius, Owsjannikow, H.
M&uuml;ller, Stieda, Marcusen, J. A. Ryder, E. A. Andrews, T. H.
Morgan, G. B. Grassi, R. Semon, Howard Ayers, R. R. Wright,
J. P. McMurrich, C. O. Whitman, A. C. Eyclesheimer, E. Pallis,
Jacob Reighard, and J. B. Johnston.</p>

<p>Besides all this, there has risen, especially in the United
States, Great Britain, Norway, and Canada and Australia, a
vast literature of commercial fisheries, fish culture, and angling,
the chief workers in which fields we may not here enumerate
even by name.</p>

THE COLLECTION OF FISHES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_429.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">How</span> to Secure Fishes.</b>&mdash;In collecting fishes three things
are vitally necessary&mdash;a keen eye, some skill in
adapting means to ends, and some willingness
to take pains in the preservation of material.</p>

<p>In coming into a new district the collector should try to
preserve the first specimen of every species he sees. It may
not come up again. He should watch carefully for specimens
which look just a little different from their fellows, especially
for those which are duller, less striking, or with lower fins. Many
species have remained unnoticed through generations of collectors
who have chosen the handsomest or most ornate specimens.
In some groups with striking peculiarities, as the trunkfishes,
practically all the species were known to Linn&aelig;us. No
collector could pass them by. On the other hand, new gobies
or blennies can be picked up almost every day in the lesser
known parts of the world. For these overlooked forms&mdash;herrings,
anchovies, sculpins, blennies, gobies, scorpion-fishes&mdash;the
competent collector should be always on the watch. If any
specimen looks different from the rest, take it at once and find
out the reason why.</p>

<p>In most regions the chief dependence of the collector is on
the markets and these should be watched most critically. By
paying a little more for unusual, neglected, or useless fish, the
supply of these will rise to the demand. The word passed
along among the people of Onomichi in Japan, that "Ebisu
the fish-god was in the village" and would pay more for
okose (poison scorpion-fishes) and umiuma (sea-horses) than
real fishes were worth soon brought (in 1900) all sorts of okose
and umiuma into the market when they were formerly left
neglected on the beach. Thus with a little ingenuity the markets
in any country can be greatly extended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>The collector can, if he thinks best, use all kinds of fishing
tackle for himself. In Japan he can use the "dabonawa" long
lines, and secure the fishes which were otherwise dredged by
the <i>Challenger</i> and <i>Albatross</i>. If dredges or trawls are at his
hand he can hire them and use them for scientific purposes.
He should neglect no kind of bottom, no conditions of fish life
which he can reach.</p>

<p>Especially important is the fauna of the tide-pools, neglected
by almost all collectors. As the tide goes down, especially
on rocky capes which project into the sea, myriads of
little fishes will remain in the rock-pools, the alg&aelig;, and the clefts
of rock. In regions like California, where the rocks are buried
with kelp, blennies will lie in the kelp as quiescent as the
branches of the alg&aelig; themselves until the flow of water returns.</p>

<p>A sharp three-tined fork will help in spearing them. The
water in pools can be poisoned on the coast of Mexico with the
milky juice of the "hava" tree, a tree which yields strychnine.
In default of this, pools can be poisoned by chloride of lime,
sulphate of copper, or, if small enough, by formaline. Of
all poisons the commercial chloride of lime seems to be most
effective. By such means the contents of the pool can be
secured and the next tide carries away the poison. The
water in pools can be bailed out, or, better, emptied by a
siphon made of small garden-hose or rubber tubing. On
rocky shores, dynamite can be used to advantage if the collector
or his assistant dare risk it and if the laws of the
country do not prevent.</p>

<p>Most effective in rock-pool work is the help of the small
boy. In all lands the collector will do well to take him into
his pay and confidence. Of the hundred or more new species
of rock-pool fishes lately secured by the writer in Japan, fully
two-thirds were obtained by the Japanese boys. Equally
effective is the "muchacho" on the coasts of Mexico.</p>

<p>Masses of coral, sponges, tunicates, and other porous or
hollow organisms often contain small fishes and should be carefully
examined. On the coral reefs the breaking up of large
masses is often most remunerative.</p>

<p>The importance of securing the young of pelagic fishes by
tow-nets and otherwise cannot be too strongly emphasized.</p>

<p><b>How to Preserve Fishes.</b>&mdash;Fishes must be permanently preserved
in alcohol. Dried skins are far from satisfactory, except
as a choice of difficulties in the case of large species.</p>

<p>Dr. G&uuml;nther thus describes the process of skinning fishes:</p>

<p>"Scaly fishes are skinned thus: With a strong pair of scissors
an incision is made along the median line of the abdomen from
the foremost part of the throat, passing on one side of the base
of the ventral and anal fins to the root of the caudal fin, the
cut, being continued upward to the back of the tail close to
the base of the caudal. The skin of one side of the fish is then
severed with the scalpel from the underlying muscles to the
median line of the back; the bones which support the dorsal
and caudal are cut through, so that these fins remain attached
to the skin. The removal of the skin of the opposite side is
easy. More difficult is the preparation of the head and scapulary
region. The two halves of the scapular arch which have
been severed from each other by the first incision are pressed
toward the right and left, and the spine is severed behind the
head, so that now only the head and shoulder bones remain
attached to the skin. These parts have to be cleaned from
the inside, all soft parts, the branchial and hyoid apparatus,
and all smaller bones being cut away with the scissors or scraped
off with the scalpel. In many fishes which are provided with
a characteristic dental apparatus in the pharynx (Labroids,
Cyprinoids), the pharyngeal bones ought to be preserved and
tied with a thread to their specimen. The skin being now
prepared so far, its entire inner surface as well as the inner side
of the head are rubbed with arsenical soap; cotton-wool or
some other soft material is inserted into any cavities or hollows,
and finally a thin layer of the same material is placed
between the two flaps of the skin. The specimen is then dried
under a slight weight to keep it from shrinking.</p>

<p>"The scales of some fishes, as for instance of many kinds of
herrings, are so delicate and deciduous that the mere handling
causes them to rub off easily. Such fishes may be covered
with thin-paper (tissue paper is the best) which is allowed to
dry on them before skinning. There is no need for removing
the paper before the specimen has reached its destination.</p>

<p>"Scaleless fishes, as siluroids and sturgeons, are skinned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
the same manner, but the skin can be rolled up over the head;
such skins can also be preserved in spirits, in which case the
traveler may save to himself the trouble of cleaning the head.</p>

<p>"Some sharks are known to attain to a length of thirty feet,
and some rays to a width of twenty feet. The preservation of
such gigantic specimens is much to be recommended, and
although the difficulties of preserving fishes increase with their
size, the operation is facilitated, because the skins of all sharks
and rays can easily be preserved in salt and strong brine.
Sharks are skinned much in the same way as ordinary fishes.
In rays an incision is made not only from the snout to the end
of the fleshy part of the tail, but also a second across the widest
part of the body. When the skin is removed from the fish,
it is placed into a cask with strong brine mixed with alum,
the head occupying the upper part of the cask; this is necessary,
because this part is most likely to show signs of decomposition,
and therefore most requires supervision. When the preserving
fluid has become decidedly weaker from the extracted blood
and water, it is thrown away and replaced by fresh brine. After
a week's or fortnight's soaking the skin is taken out of the cask
to allow the fluid to drain off; its inner side is covered with a
thin layer of salt, and after being rolled up (the head being
inside) it is packed in a cask the bottom of which is covered
with salt; all the interstices and the top are likewise filled with
salt. The cask must be perfectly water-tight."</p>

<p><b>Value of Formalin.</b>&mdash;In the field it is much better to use
formalin (formaldehyde) in preference to alcohol. This is an
antiseptic fluid dissolved in water, and it at once arrests decay,
leaving the specimen as though preserved in water. If left
too long in formalin fishes swell, the bones are softened, and
the specimens become brittle or even worthless. But for ordinary
purposes (except use as skeleton) no harm arises from two
or three months' saturation in formalin. The commercial
formalin can be mixed with about twenty parts of water. On
the whole it is better to have the solution too weak rather than
too strong. Too much formalin makes the specimens stiff,
swollen, and intractable, besides too soon destroying the color.</p>

<p>Formalin has the advantage, in collecting, of cheapness
and of ease in transportation, as a single small bottle will make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
a large amount of the fluid. The specimens also require much
less attention. An incision should be made in the (right) side
of the abdomen to let in the fluid. The specimen can then be
placed in formalin. When saturated, in the course of the day,
it can be wrapped in a cloth, packed in an empty petroleum
can, and at once shipped. The wide use of petroleum in all
parts of the world is a great boon to the naturalist.</p>

<p>Before preservation, the fishes should be washed, to remove
slime and dirt. They should have an incision to let the fluid
into the body cavity and an injection with a syringe is a useful
help to saturation, especially with large fishes. Even decaying
fishes can be saved with formalin.</p>

<p><b>Records of Fishes.</b>&mdash;The collector should mark localities
most carefully with tin tags and note-book records if possible.
He should, so far as possible, keep records of life colors, and
water-color sketches are of great assistance in this matter. In
spirits or formalin the life colors soon fade, although the pattern
of marking is usually preserved or at least indicated. A
mixture of formalin and alcohol is favorable to the preservation
of markings.</p>

<p>In the museum all specimens should be removed at once
from formalin to alcohol. No substitute for alcohol as a permanent
preservative has been found. The spirits derived
from wine, grain, or sugar is much preferable to the poisonous
methyl or wood alcohol.</p>

<p>In placing specimens directly into alcohol, care should be
taken not to crowd them too much. The fish yields water
which dilutes the spirit. For the same reason, spirits too dilute
are ineffective. On the other hand, delicate fishes put into
very strong alcohol are likely to shrivel, a condition which may
prevent an accurate study of their fins or other structures. It
is usually necessary to change a fish from the first alcohol used
as a bath into stronger alcohol in the course of a few days, the
time depending on the closeness with which fishes are packed.
In the tropics, fishes in alcohol often require attention within
a few hours. In formalin there is much less difficulty with
tropical fishes.</p>

<p>Fishes intended for skeletons should never be placed in
formalin. A softening of the bones which prevents future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
exact studies of the bones is sure to take place. Generally
alcohol or other spirits (arrack, brandy, cognac, rum, sake
"vino") can be tested with a match. If sufficiently concentrated
to be ignited, they can be safely used for preservation
of fishes. The best test is that of the hydrometer. Spirits
for permanent use should show on the hydrometer 40 to 60
above proof. Decaying specimens show it by color and smell
and the collector should be alive to their condition. One rotting
fish may endanger many others. With alcohol it is necessary
to take especial pains to ensure immediate saturation.
Deep cuts should be made into the muscles of large fishes as
well as into the body cavity. Sometimes a small distilling
apparatus is useful to redistil impure or dilute alcohol. The
use of formalin avoids this necessity.</p>

<p>Small fishes should not be packed with large ones; small
bottles are very desirable for their preservation. All spinous
or scaly fishes should be so wrapped in cotton muslin as to
prevent all friction.</p>

<p><b>Eternal Vigilance.</b>&mdash;The methods of treating individual
groups of fishes and of handling them under different climatic
and other conditions are matters to be learned by experience.
Eternal vigilance is the price of a good collection, as it is said
to be of some other good things. Mechanical collecting&mdash;picking
up the thing got without effort and putting it in alcohol
without further thought&mdash;rarely serves any useful end in science.
The best collectors are usually the best naturalists. The collections
made by the men who are to study them and who are
competent to do so are the ones which most help the progress
of ichthyology. The student of a group of fishes misses half
the collection teaches if he has made no part of it himself.</p>

THE EVOLUTION OF FISHES</h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Geological Distribution of Fishes.</b>&mdash;The oldest unquestioned
remains of fishes have been very recently
made known by Mr. Charles D. Walcott, from rocks
of the Trenton period in the Ordovician or Lower Silurian.
These are from Ca&ntilde;on City in Colorado. Among these is certainly
a small Ostracophore (<i>Asteraspis desideratus</i>). With it
are fragments (<i>Dictyorhabdus</i>) thought to be the back-bone of a
Chim&aelig;ra, but more likely, in Dean's view, the axis of a cephalopod,
besides bony, wrinkled scales, referred with doubt to a supposed
Crossopterygian genus called <i>Eriptychius</i>. This renders
certain the existence of <i>Ostracophores</i> at this early period, but
their association with <i>Chim&aelig;ras</i> and Crossopterygians is questionable.
Primitive sharks may have existed in Ordovician times,
but thus far no trace of them has been found.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>

<p>The fish-remains next in age in America are from the Bloomfield
sandstone in Pennsylvania of the Onondaga period in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
upper Silurian. The earliest in Europe are found in the Ludlow
shales, both of these localities being in or near the horizon of
the Niagara rocks, in the Upper Silurian Age.</p>

<p>It is, however, certain that these Lower Silurian remains do
not represent the beginning of fish-life. Probably <i>Ostracophores</i>,
and <i>Arthrodires</i>, with perhaps Crossopterygians and Dipnoans,
existed at an earlier period, together perhaps with unarmed,
limbless forms without jaws, of which no trace whatever has
been left.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Earliest Sharks.</b>&mdash;The first actual trace of sharks is
found in the Upper Silurian in the form of fin-spines (<i>Onchus</i>),
thought to belong to primitive sharks, perhaps Acanthodeans
possibly to Ostracophores. With these are numerous bony
shields of the mailed Ostracophores, and somewhat later those
of the more highly specialized Arthrodires. Later appear the
teeth of <i>Cochliodontid&aelig;</i>, with Chim&aelig;ras, a few Dipnoans, and
Crossopterygians.</p>

<p><b>Devonian Fishes.</b>&mdash;In the Devonian Age the <i>Ostracophores</i>
increase in size and abundance, disappearing with the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
of the Carboniferous. The Arthrodires also increase greatly
in variety and in size, reaching their culmination in the Devonian,
but not disappearing entirely until well in the Carboniferous.
These two groups (often united by geologists under
the older name Placoderms) together with sharks and a few
Chim&aelig;ras made up almost exclusively the rich fish-fauna of
Devonian times. The sharks were chiefly Acanthodean and
Psammodont, as far as our records show. The supposed more
primitive type of <i>Cladoselache</i> is not known to appear before
the latter part of the Devonian Age, while <i>Pleuracanthus</i> and
<i>Cladodus</i>, sometimes regarded as still more primitive, are as yet
found only in the Carboniferous. It is clear that the records
of early shark life are still incomplete, whatever view we may
adopt as to the relative rank of the different forms. Chim&aelig;roids
occur in the Devonian, and with them a considerable variety
of Crossopterygians and Dipnoans. The true fishes appear also
in the Devonian in the guise of the Ganoid ancestors and relatives
of <i>Pal&aelig;oniscum</i>, all with diamond-shaped enameled scales.
In the Devonian, too, we find the minute creature <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i>,
our ignorance of which is concealed under the name
<i>Cycli&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p><b>Carboniferous Fishes.</b>&mdash;In the Carboniferous Age the sharks
increase in number and variety, the Ostracophores disappear, and
the Arthrodires follow them soon after, the last being recorded
from the Permian. Other forms of Dipnoans, Crossopterygians,
and some Ganoids now appear giving the fauna a somewhat more
modern aspect. The <i>Acanthodei</i> and the <i>Ichthyotomi</i> pass away
with the Permian, the latest period of the Carboniferous Age.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Mesozoic Fishes.</b>&mdash;In the Triassic period which follows the
Permian, the earliest types of Ganoids give place to forms ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>proaching
the garpike and sturgeon. The Crossopterygians
rapidly decline. The Dipnoans are less varied and fewer in
number; the primitive sharks, with the exception of certain
Cestracionts, all disappear, only the family of <i>Orodontid&aelig;</i> remaining.
Here are found the first true bony fishes, doubtless derived
from Ganoid stock, the allies and predecessors of the great group
of herrings. Herring-like forms become more numerous in the
Jurassic, and with them appear other forms which give the fish-fauna
of this period something of a modern appearance. In the
Jurassic the sharks become divided into several groups, <i>Notidani</i>,
Scyllioid sharks, Lamnoid sharks, angel-fishes, skates, and finally
Carcharioid sharks being now well differentiated. Chim&aelig;ras are
still numerous. The <i>Acanthodei</i> have passed away, as well as the
mailed Ostrachopores and Arthrodires. The Dipnoans and
Crossopterygians are few. The early Ganoids have given place to
more modern types, still in great abundance and variety. This
condition continues in the Cretaceous period. Here the rays
and modern sharks increase in number, the Ganoids hold
their own, and the other groups of soft-rayed fishes, as the
smelts, the lantern-fishes, the pikes, the flying-fishes, the berycoids
and the mackerels join the group of herring-like forms which
represent the modern bony fishes. In the Cretaceous appear
the first spiny-rayed fishes, derived probably from herring-like
forms. These are allies or ancestors of the living genus <i>Beryx</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Woodward observes:</p>

<p>"As soon as fishes with a completely osseous endoskeleton
began to predominate at the dawn of the Cretaceous period,
specializations of an entirely new kind were rapidly acquired.
Until this time the skull of the Actinopterygii had always been
remarkably uniform in type. The otic region of the cranium
often remained incompletely ossified and was never prominent
or projecting beyond the roof bones; the supraoccipital bone
was always small and covered with the superficial plates; the
maxilla invariably formed the greater part of the upper jaw;
the cheek-plates were large and usually thick; while none of
the head or opercular bones were provided with spines or ridges.
The pelvic fins always retained their primitive remote situation,
and the fin-rays never became spines. During the Cretaceous
period the majority of the bony fishes began to exhibit modifications
in all these characters, and the changes occurred so
rapidly that by the dawn of the Eocene period the diversity
observable in the dominant fish-fauna was much greater than
it had ever been before. At this remote period, indeed, nearly
all the great groups of bony fishes, as represented in the existing
world, were already differentiated, and their subsequent
modifications have been quite of a minor character."</p>

</div>

<p><b>Tertiary Fishes.</b>&mdash;With the Eocene or first period of the
Tertiary great changes have taken place. The early families
of bony fishes nearly all disappear. The herring, pike, smelt,
salmon, flying-fish, and berycoids remain, and a multitude of
other forms seem to spring into sudden existence. Among
these are the globefishes, the trigger-fishes, the catfishes, the
eels, the morays, the butterfly-fishes, the porgies, the perch,
the bass, the pipefishes, the trumpet-fishes, the mackerels, and
the John-dories, with the sculpins, the anglers, the flounders,
the blennies, and the cods. That all these groups, generalized
and specialized, arose at once is impossible, although all seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
to date from the Eocene times. Doubtless each of them had
its origin at an earlier period, and the simultaneous appearance
is related to the fact of the thorough study of the Eocene shales,
which have in numerous localities (London, Monte Bolca, Licata,
Mount Lebanon, Green River) been especially favorable for
the preservation of these forms. Practically fossil fishes have
been thoroughly studied as yet only in a very few parts of
the earth. The rocks of Scotland, England, Germany, Italy,
Switzerland, Syria, Ohio, and Wyoming have furnished the
great bulk of all the fish remains in existence. In some regions
perhaps collections will be made which will give us a more just
conception of the origin of the different groups of bony fishes.
We can now only say with certainty that the modern families
were largely existent in the Eocene, that they sprang from
ganoid stock found in the Triassic and Jurassic, that several of
them were represented in the Cretaceous also, that the Berycoids
were earliest of the spiny-rayed fishes, and forms allied to herring
the earliest of the soft-rayed forms. Few modern families arose
before the Cretaceous. Few of the modern genera go back to
the Eocene, many of them arose in the Miocene, and few species
have come down to us from rocks older than the end of the
Pliocene. The general modern type of the fish-faunas being
determined in the latter Eocene and the Miocene, the changes
which bring us to recent times have largely concerned the
abundance and variety of the individual species. From geological
distribution we have arising the varied problems of
geographical distribution and the still more complex conditions
on which depend the extinction of species and of types.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Factors of Extinction.</b>&mdash;These factors of extinction have
been recently formulated as follows by Professor Herbert Osborn.
He considers the process of extinction as of five different types:</p>

<p>"(1) That extinction which comes from modification or
progressive evolution, a relegation to the past as a result of
the transmutation into more advanced forms. (2) Extinction
from changes of physical environment which outrun the powers
of adaptation. (3) The extinction which results from competition.
(4) The extinction which results from extreme specialization
and limitation to special conditions the loss of which
means extinction. (5) Extinction as a result of exhaustion."</p>

<p><b>Fossilization of a Fish.</b>&mdash;When a fish dies he leaves no friends.
His body is at once attacked by hundreds of creatures ranging
from the one-celled protozoa and bacteria to individuals of his
own species. His flesh is devoured, his bones are scattered,
the gelatinous substance in them decays, and the phosphate of
lime is in time dissolved in the water. For this reason few fishes
of the millions which die each year leave any trace for future
preservation. At the most a few teeth, a fin-spine, or a bone
buried in the clay might remain intact or in such condition as to
be recognized.</p>

<p>But now and then it happens that a dead fish may fall in
more fortunate conditions. On a sea bottom of fine clay the
bones, or even the whole body, may be buried in such a way as
to be sealed up and protected from total decomposition. The
flesh will usually disappear and leave no mark or at the most a
mere cast of its surface. But the hard parts, even the muscles
may persist, and now and then they do persist, the salts of lime
unchanged or else silicified or subjected to some other form of
chemical substitution. Only the scales, the teeth, the bones, the
spines, and the fin-rays can be preserved in the rocks of sea or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
lake bottom. In a few localities, as near Green River in Wyoming,
Monte Bolca, near Verona, and Mount Lebanon in Syria,
the London clays, with certain quarries in Scotland and lithographic
stones in Germany, many skeletons of fishes have been
found pressed flat in layers of very fine rock, their structures
traced as delicately as if actually drawn on the smooth stone.
Fragments preserved in ruder fashion abound in the clays and
even the sandstones of the earliest geologic ages. In most cases,
however, fossil fishes are known from detached and scattered fragments,
many of them, especially of the sharks, by the teeth alone.
Fishes have occurred in all ages from the Silurian to the present
time and probably the very first lived long before the Silurian.</p>

<p><b>The Earliest Fishes.</b>&mdash;No one can say what the earliest fishes
were like, nor do we know what was their real relation to the
worm-like forms among which men have sought their presumable
ancestors, nor to the Tunicates and other chordate forms, not
fish-like, but still degenerate relatives of the primeval fish.</p>

<p>From analogy we may suppose that the first fishes which
ever were bore some resemblance to the lancelet, for that is a
fish-like creature with every structure reduced to the lowest
terms. But as the lancelet has no hard parts, no bones, nor
teeth, nor scales, nor fins, no traces of its kind are found among
the fossils. If the primitive fish was like it in important respects,
all record of this has probably vanished from the earth.</p>

<p><b>The Cyclostomes.</b>&mdash;The next group of living fishes, the
Cyclostomes, including the hagfishes and lampreys,&mdash;fishes
with small skull and brain but without limbs or jaws,&mdash;stands
at a great distance above the lancelet in complexity of structure,
and equally far from the true fishes in its primitive simplicity.
In fact the lamprey is farther from the true fish in
structure than a perch is from an eagle. Yet for all that it may
be an offshoot from the primitive line of fish descent. There
is not much in the structure of the lamprey which may be preserved
in the rocks. But the cartilaginous skull, the back-bone,
fins, and teeth might leave their traces in soft clay or lithographic
stone. But it is certain that they have not done so in any
rocks yet explored, and it may be that the few existing lampreys
owe their form and structure to a process of degradation from
a more complex and more fish-like ancestry. The supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
lamprey fossil of the Devonian of Scotland, <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i>,
has little in common with the true lampreys.</p>

<p><b>The Ostracophores.</b>&mdash;Besides the lampreys the Devonian seas
swarmed with mysterious creatures covered with an armor of
plate, fish-like in some regards, but limbless, without true jaws
and very different from the true fishes of to-day. These are
called Ostracophori, and some have regarded them as mailed
lampreys, but they are more likely to be a degenerate or eccentric
offshoot from the sharks, as highly modified or specialized
lampreys, a side offshoot which has left no descendants among
recent forms. Recently Professor Patten has insisted that the
resemblance of their head-plates to those of the horseshoe crab
(<i>Limulus</i>) is indicative of real affinity.</p>

<p>Among these forms in mail-armor are some in which the
jointed and movable angles of the head suggest the pectoral
spines of some catfishes. But in spite of its resemblance to a
fin, the spine in <i>Pterichthyodes</i> is an outgrowth of the ossified
skin and has no more homology with the spines of fishes than
the mailed plates have with the bones of a fish's cranium. In
none of these fishes has any trace of an internal skeleton been
found. It must have retained its primitive gelatinous character.
There are, however, some traces of eyes, and the mucous channels
of the lateral line indicate that these creatures possessed some
other special senses.</p>

</div>

<p>Whatever the Ostracophores may be, they should not be included
within the much-abused term <i>Ganoidei</i>, a word which was
once used in the widest fashion for all sorts of mailed fishes, but
little by little restricted to the hard-scaled relatives and ancestors
of the garpike of to-day.</p>

<p><b>The Arthrodires.</b>&mdash;Dimly seen in the vast darkness of Paleozoic
time are the huge creatures known as Arthrodires. These
are mailed and helmeted fishes, limbless so far as we know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
but with sharp, notched, turtle-like jaws quite different from
those of the fish or those of any animal alive to-day. These
creatures appear in Silurian rocks and are especially abundant
in the fossil beds of Ohio, where Newberry, Claypole, Eastman,
Dean and others have patiently studied the broken fragments
of their armor. Most of them have a great casque on the head
with a shield at the neck and a movable joint connecting the
two. Among them was almost every variation in size and form.</p>

</div>

<p>These creatures have been often called ganoids, but with
the true ganoids like the garpike they have seemingly nothing
in common. They are also different from the Ostracophores.
To regard them with Woodward as derived from ancestral
Dipnoans is to give a possible guess as to their origin, and a very
unsatisfactory guess at that. In any event these have all passed
away in competition with the scaly fishes and sharks of later
evolution, and it seems certain that they, like the mailed Ostracophores,
have left no descendants.</p>

<p><b>The Sharks.</b>&mdash;Next after the lampreys, but a long way after
them in structure, come the sharks. With the sharks appear
for the first time true limbs and the lower jaw. The upper
jaw is, however, formed from the palate, and the shoulder-girdle
is attached behind the skull. "Little is known," says
Professor Dean, "of the primitive stem of the sharks, and even
the lines of descent of the different members of the group can
only be generally suggested. The development of recent forms
has yielded few results of undoubted value to the phylogenist.
It would appear as if paleontology alone could solve the puzzles
of their descent."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the very earliest sharks in the Upper Silurian Age the
remains are too scanty to prove much save that there were sharks
in abundance and variety. Spines, teeth, fragments of shagreen,
show that in some regards these forms were highly specialized.
In the Carboniferous Age the sharks became highly varied and
extensively specialized. Of the Paleozoic types, however, all
but a single family seems to have died out, leaving Cestraciontes
only in the Permian and Triassic. From these the modern
sharks one and all may very likely have descended.</p>

<p><b>Origin of the Sharks.</b>&mdash;Perhaps the sharks are developed from
the still more primitive shark imagined as without limbs and
with the teeth slowly formed from modification of the ordinary
shagreen prickles. In determining the earliest among the
several primitive types of shark actually known we are stopped
by an undetermined question of theory. What is the origin
of paired limbs? Are these formed, like the unpaired fins,
from the breaking up of a continuous fold of skin, in accordance
with the view of Balfour and others? Or is the primitive limb,
as supposed by Gegenbaur, a modification of the bony gill-arch?
Or again, as supposed by Kerr, is it a modification of
the hard axis of an external gill?</p>

<p>If we adopt the views of Gegenbaur or Kerr, the earliest
type of limb is the jointed <i>archipterygium</i>, a series of consecutive
rounded cartilaginous elements with a fringe of rays along its
length. Sharks possessing this form of limb (<i>Ichthyotomi</i>)
appear in the Carboniferous rocks, but are not known earlier. It
may be that from these the Dipnoans, on the one hand, may be
descended and, on the other, the true sharks and the Chim&aelig;ras;
but there is no certainty that the jointed arm or archipterygium
of the Dipnoans is derived from the similar pectoral fin of the
<i>Ichthyotomi</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we regard the paired fins as parts of
a lateral fold of skin, we find primitive sharks to bear out
our conclusions. In <i>Cladoselache</i> of the Upper Devonian, the
pectoral and the ventral fins are long and low, and arranged
just as they might be if Balfour's theory were true. <i>Acanthoessus</i>,
with a spine in each paired fin and no other rays, might
be a specialization of this type or fin, and <i>Climatius</i>, with rows
of spines in place of pectorals and ventrals, might be held to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
bear out the same idea. In all these the tail is less primitive
than in the <i>Ichthyotomi</i>. On the other hand, the vent in <i>Cladoselache</i>
is thought by Dean to have been near the end of the tail.
If this is the case, it should indicate a very primitive character.
On the whole, though there is much to be said in favor of the
primitive nature of the <i>Ichthyotomi</i> (<i>Pleuracanthus</i>) with the
tapering tail and jointed pectoral fin of a dipnoan, and other
traits of a shark, yet, on the whole, <i>Cladoselache</i> is probably
nearer the origin of the shark-like forms.</p>

<p>The relatively primitive sharks called <i>Notidani</i> have the
weakly ossified vertebr&aelig; joined together in pairs and there are
six or seven gill-openings. This group has persisted to our
day, the frilled shark (<i>Chlamydoselachus</i>) and the genera <i>Hexanchus</i>
and <i>Heptranchias</i> still showing its archaic characters.</p>

<p>Here the sharks diverge into two groups, the one with the
vertebr&aelig; better developed and its calcareous matter arranged
star-fashion. This forms Hasse's group of <i>Asterospondyli</i>, the
typical sharks. The earliest forms (<i>Orodontid&aelig;</i>, <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>)
approach the <i>Notidani</i>, and so far as geological records go,
precede all the other modern sharks. One such ancient type,
<i>Heterodontus</i>, including the bullhead shark, and the Port
Jackson shark, still persists. The others diverge to form the
three chief groups of the cat-sharks (<i>Scyliorhinus</i>, etc.),
the mackerel-sharks (<i>Lamna</i>, etc.), and the true sharks (<i>Carcharhias</i>,
etc.).</p>

Santa Barbara, Cal.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the second group the vertebr&aelig; have their calcareous matter
arranged in rings, one or more about the notochordal center.
In all these the anal fin is absent, and in the process of speciali<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>zation
the shark gradually gives place to the flattened body
and broad fins of the ray. This group is called <i>Tectospondyli</i>.
Those sharks of this group with one ring of calcareous matter
in each vertebra constitute the most primitive extreme of a
group representing continuous evolution.</p>

<p>From <i>Cladoselache</i> and <i>Chlamydoselachus</i> through the sharks
to the rays we have an almost continuous series which reaches
its highest development in the devil rays or mantas of the tropical
seas, <i>Manta</i> and <i>Mobula</i> being the most specialized genera and
among the very largest of the fishes. However different the rays
and skates may appear in form and habit, they are structurally
similar to the sharks and have sprung from the main shark
stem.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Chim&aelig;ras.</b>&mdash;The most ancient offshoot from the shark
stem, perhaps dating from Silurian times and possibly separated
at a period earlier than the date of any known shark, is the
group of <i>Holocephali</i> or Chim&aelig;ras, shark-like in essentials, but
differing widely in details. Of these there are but few living
forms and the fossil types are known only from dental plates
and fin-spines. The living forms are found in the deeper seas the
world over, one of the simplest in structure being the newly dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>covered
<i>Rhinochim&aelig;ra</i> of Japan. The fusion of the teeth into
overlapping plates, the covering of the gills by a dermal flap,
the complete union of the palato-quadrate apparatus or upper
jaw with the skull and the development of a peculiar clasping
spine on the forehead of the male are characteristic of the Chim&aelig;ras.
The group is one of the most ancient, but it ends
with itself, none of the modern fishes being derived from
Chim&aelig;ras.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Dipnoans.</b>&mdash;The most important offshoot of the primitive
sharks is not the Chim&aelig;ras, nor even the shark series itself, but
the groups of Crossopterygians and Dipnoans, or lung-fishes, with
the long chain of their descendants. With the Dipnoan appears
the lung or air-bladder, at first an outgrowth from the ventral
side of the &oelig;sophagus, as it still is in all higher animals, but
later turning over, among fishes, and springing from the dorsal
side. At first an arrangement for breathing air, a sort of
accessory gill, it becomes the sole organs of respiration in
the higher forms, while in the bony fishes its respiratory function
is lost altogether. The air-bladder is a degenerate lung. In the
Dipnoans the shoulder-girdle moves forward to the skull, and
the pectoral limb, a jointed and fringed archipterygium, is its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
characteristic appendage. The shark-like structure of the
mouth remains.</p>

<p>The few living lung-fishes resemble the salamanders in
many regards, and some writers have ranged the class as
midway between the primitive sharks and the amphibians.
These forms show their intermediate characters in the development
of lungs and in the primitive character of the pectoral and
ventral limbs. Those now extant give but little idea of the
great variety of extinct Dipnoans. The living genera are three
in number&mdash;<i>Neoceratodus</i> in Australian rivers, <i>Lepidosiren</i> in
the Amazon, and <i>Protopterus</i> in the Nile. These are all mudfishes,
some of them living through most of the dry season
encased in a cocoon of dried mud. Of these forms <i>Neoceratodus</i>
is certainly the nearest to the ancient forms, but its embryology,
owing to the shortening of its growth stages due to its environment,
has thrown little light on the question of its ancestry.</p>

<p>From some ally of the Dipnoans the ancestry of the amphibians,
and through them that of the reptiles, birds, and mammals
may be traced, although a good deal of evidence has
been produced in favor of regarding the primitive crossopterygian
or fringe fin as the point of divergence. It is not unlikely
that the Crossopterygian gave rise to Amphibian and
Dipnoan alike.</p>

<p>In the process of development we next reach the characteristic
fish mouth in which the upper jaw is formed of maxillary
and premaxillary elements distinct from the skull. The upper
jaw of the shark is part of the palate, the palate being fused
with the quadrate bone which supports the lower jaw. That
of the Dipnoan is much the same. The development of a typical
fish mouth is the next step in evolution, and with its appearance
we note the decline of the air-bladder in size and function.</p>

<p><b>The Crossopterygians.</b>&mdash;The fish-like mouth appears with the
group of Crossopterygians, fishes which still retain the old-fashioned
type of pectoral and ventral fin, the archipterygium.
In the archaic tail, enameled scales, and cartilaginous skeleton
the Crossopterygian shows its affinity with its Dipnoan ancestry.
Thus these fishes unite in themselves traits of the shark, lung-fish,
and Ganoid. The few living Crossopterygians, <i>Polypterus</i>
and <i>Erpetoichthys</i>, are not very different from those which pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>vailed
in Devonian times. The larv&aelig; possess external gills
with firm base and fringe-like rays, suggesting a resemblance
to the pectoral fin itself, which develops from the shoulder-girdle
just below it and would seem to give some force to Kerr's contention
that the archipterygium is only a modified external
gill. In <i>Polypterus</i> the archipterygium has become short and
fan-shaped, its axis made of two diverging bones with flat
cartilage between. From this type it is thought that the arm
of the higher forms has been developed. The bony basis may be
the humerus, from which diverge radius and ulna, the carpal
bones being formed of the intervening cartilage.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Actinopteri.</b>&mdash;From the Crossopterygians springs the
main branch of the true fishes, known collectively as <i>Actinopteri</i>,
or ray-fins, those with ordinary rays on the paired fins instead
of the jointed archipterygium. The transitional series of primitive
<i>Actinopteri</i> are usually known as Ganoids. The Ganoid
differs from the Crossopterygian in having the basal elements
of the paired fins small and concealed within the flesh. But
other associated characters of the Crossopterygii and Dipnoans
are preserved in most of the species. Among these are the
mailed head and body, the heterocercal tail, the cellular air-bladder,
the presence of valves in the arterial bulb, the presence
of a spiral valve in the intestine and of a chiasma in the optic
nerves. All these characters are found in the earlier types so
far as is known, and all are more or less completely lost or
altered in the teleosts or bony fishes. Among these early
types is every variety of form, some of them being almost as long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
as deep, others arrow-shaped, and every intermediate form being
represented. An offshoot from this line is the bowfin (<i>Amia
calva</i>), among the Ganoids the closest living ally of the bony
fishes, showing distinct affinities with the great group to which
the herring and salmon belong. Near relatives of the bowfin
flourished in the Mesozoic, among them some with a forked tail,
and some with a very long one. From Ganoids of this type
the vast majority of recent fishes may be descended.</p>

<p>Another branch of Ganoids, divergent from both garfish and
bowfin and not recently from the same primitive stock, included
the sturgeons (<i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>, <i>Kessleria</i>) and the
paddle-fishes (<i>Polyodon</i> and <i>Psephurus</i>). All these are regarded
by Woodward as degenerate descendants of the earliest Ganoids,
<i>Pal&aelig;oniscid&aelig;</i>, of Devonian and Carboniferous time.</p>

<p><b>The Bony Fishes.</b>&mdash;All the remaining fishes have ossified
instead of cartilaginous skeletons. The dipnoan and ganoid
traits one by one are more or less completely lost. Through
these the main line of fish development continues and the
various groups are known collectively as bony fishes or teleosts.</p>

</div>

<p>The earliest of the true bony fishes or teleosts appear in Mesozoic
times, the most primitive forms being soft-rayed fishes with
the vertebr&aelig; all similar in form, allied more or less remotely
to the herring of to-day, but connected in an almost unbroken
series with the earliest ganoid forms. In these and other soft-rayed
fishes the pelvis still retains its posterior insertion, the
ventral fins being said to be abdominal. The next great stage
in evolution brings the pelvis forward, attaching it to the shoulder-girdle
so that the ventral fins are now thoracic as in the perch
and bass. If brought to a point in front of the pectoral fins,
a feature of specialized degradation, they become jugular as in
the codfish. In the abdominal fishes the air-bladder still retains
its rudimentary duct joining it to the &oelig;sophagus.</p>

<p>From the abdominal forms allied to the herring, the huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
array of modern fishes, typified by the perch, the bass, the
mackerel, the wrasse, the globefish, the sculpin, the sea-horse,
and the cod descended in many diverging lines. The earliest
of the spine-rayed fishes with thoracic fins belong to the type
of <i>Berycid&aelig;</i>, a group characterized by rough scales, the retention
of a primitive bone between the eyes, and the retention of
the primitive larger number of ventral rays. These appear
in the Cretaceous or chalk deposits, and show various attributes
of transition from the abdominal to the thoracic type of ventrals.</p>

<p>Another line of descent apparently distinct from that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
herring and salmon extends through the characins to the loach,
carps, catfishes, and electric eel. The fishes of this series have
the anterior vertebr&aelig; coossified and modified in connection with
the hearing organ, a structure not appearing elsewhere among
fishes. This group includes the majority of fresh-water fishes.
Still another great group, the eels, have lost the ventral fins
and the bones of the head have suffered much degradation.</p>

<p>The most highly developed fishes, all things considered, are
doubtless the allies of the perch, bass, and sculpin. These fishes
have lost the air-duct and on the whole they show the greatest
development of the greatest number of structures. In these
groups their traits one after another are carried to an extreme
and these stages of extreme specialization give way one after
another to phases of degeneration. The specialization of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
organ usually involves degeneration of some other. Extreme
specialization of any organ tends to render it useless under other
conditions and may be one step toward its final degradation.</p>

<p>We have thus seen, in hasty review, that the fish-like vertebrates
spring from an unknown and possibly worm-like stock,
that from this stock, before it became vertebrate, degenerate
branches have fallen off, represented to-day by the <i>Tunicates</i>
and <i>Enteropneustans</i>. We have seen that the primitive vertebrate
was headless and limbless and without hard parts. The
lancelet remains as a possible direct offshoot from it; the cyclostome
with brain and skull is a possible derivative from archaic
lancelets. The earliest fishes leaving traces in the rocks were
mailed ostracophores. From an unknown but possibly lamprey-like
stock sprang the sharks and chim&aelig;ras. The sharks developed
into rays in one right line and into the highest sharks
along another, while by a side branch through lost stages the
primitive sharks passed into Crossopterygians, into Dipnoans,
or lung-fishes, and perhaps into Ostracophores. All these types<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
and others abound in the Devonian Age and the early records
were lost in the Silurian. From the Crossopterygians or their
ancestors or descendants by the specialization of the lung and
limbs, the land animals, at first amphibians, after these reptiles,
birds, and mammals, arose.</p>

<p>In the sea, by a line still more direct, through the gradual
emphasis of fish-like characters, we find developed the Crossopterygians
with archaic limbs and after these the Ganoids with
fish-like limbs but otherwise archaic; then the soft-rayed and
finally the spiny-rayed bony fishes, herring, mackerel, perch,
which culminate in specialized and often degraded types, as
the anglers, globefishes, parrot-fishes, and flying gurnards;
and from each of the ultimate lines of descent radiate infinite
branches till the sea and rivers are filled, and almost every
body of water has fishes fitted to its environment.</p>

THE PROTOCHORDATA</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_460.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Chordate Animals.</b>&mdash;Referring to our metaphor of
the tree with its twigs as used in the chapter on
classification we find the fishes with the higher vertebrates
as parts of a great branch from which the lower twigs
have mostly perished. This great branch, phylum, or line of
descent is known in zoology as <i>Chordata</i>, and the organisms
associated with it or composing it are chordate animals.</p>

<p>The chordate animals are those which at some stage of life
possess a notochord or primitive dorsal cartilage which divides
the interior of the body into two cavities. The dorsal cavity
contains the great nerve centers or spinal cord; the ventral
cavity contains the heart and alimentary canal. In all other
animals which possess a body cavity, there is no division by a
notochord, and the ganglia of the nervous system if existing
are placed on the ventral side or in a ring about the mouth.</p>

<p><b>The Protochordates.</b>&mdash;Modern researches have shown that
besides the ordinary back-boned animals certain other creatures
easily to be mistaken for mollusks or worms and being chordate
in structure must be regarded as offshoots from the vertebrate
branch. These are degenerate allies, as is shown by the fact
that their vertebrate traits are shown in their early or larval
development and scarcely at all in their adult condition. As
Dr. John Sterling Kingsley has well said: "Many of the species
start in life with the promise of reaching a point high in the
scale, but after a while they turn around and, as one might say,
pursue a downward course, which results in an adult which
displays but few resemblances to the other vertebrates." In
the Tunicates or Ascidians (sea-squirts, sea-pears, and salpas),
which constitute the class known as <i>Tunicata</i> or <i>Urochordata</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
there is no brain, the notochord is confined to the tail and is
usually present only in the larval stage of the animal when it
has the form of a tadpole. In later life the animal usually
becomes quiescent, attached to some hard object, fixed or floating.
It loses its form and has the appearance of a hollow,
leathery sac, the body organs being developed in a tough tunic.
There are numerous families of Tunicates and the species are
found in nearly all seas. They suggest no resemblance to
fishes and look like tough clams without shells. The internal
cavity being usually filled with water it is squirted out through
the two apertures when the animal is handled. The class
<i>Enteropneusta</i> (<i>Adelochorda</i>, or <i>Hemichordata</i>), includes the rather
rare worm-like forms related to <i>Balanoglossus</i>. Bateson has
shown that these animals possess a notochord which is developed
in the anterior part of the body. They have no fins
and before the mouth is a long proboscis. Gill-slits are found
in the larval tunicate. In <i>Balanoglossus</i> these persist through
life as in the fishes.</p>

<p>The remaining chordate forms constitute the vertebrates
proper, not worm-like nor mollusk-like, the notochord not
disappearing with age, except as it gives way, by specialized
segmentation to the complex structures of the vertebral column.
These vertebrates, which are permanently aquatic, are known
in a popular sense as fishes. The fish, in the broad sense, is
a back-boned animal which retains the homologue of the back-bone
throughout life, which does not develop jointed limbs,
its locomotive members, if present, being developed as fins,
and which breathes through life the air contained in water
by means of gills. This definition excludes the Tunicates and
Enteropneusta on the one hand and the Amphibia or Batrachia
with the reptiles, birds, and mammals on the other. The
Amphibia are much more closely related to certain fishes than
the classes of fishes are to each other. Still for purposes of
systematic study, the frogs and salamanders are left out of
the domain of ichthyology, while the Tunicata and the Enteropneusta
might well be included in it.</p>

<p>The known branchiferous or gill-bearing chordates living
and extinct may be first divided into eight classes&mdash;the <i>Enteropneusta</i>,
the <i>Tunicata</i>, the <i>Leptocardii</i>, or lancelets, the <i>Cyclostomi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
or lampreys, the <i>Elasmobranchii</i>, or sharks, the <i>Ostracophori</i>
the <i>Arthrodira</i>, and the <i>Teleostomi</i>, or true fishes. The first
two groups, being very primitive and in no respect fish-like
in appearance, are sometimes grouped together as <i>Protochordata</i>,
the others with the higher Chordates constituting the
<i>Vertebrata</i>.</p>

<p><b>Other Terms used in Classification.</b>&mdash;The Leptocardii are sometimes
called Acraniata (without skull), as distinguished from
the higher groups, Craniota, in which the skull is developed.
The <i>Leptocardii</i>, <i>Cyclostomi</i>, and <i>Ostracophori</i> are sometimes
called <i>Agnatha</i> (without jaws) in contradistinction to the <i>Gnathostomi</i>
(jaw mouths), which include the sharks and true fishes
with the higher vertebrates. The sharks and Teleostomes
are sometimes brought together as <i>Pisces</i>, or fishes, as distinguished
from other groups not true fishes. To the sharks and
true fishes the collective name of <i>Lyrifera</i> has been given,
these fishes having the harp-shaped shoulder-girdle, its parts
united below. The <i>Ostracophores</i> and <i>Arthrodires</i> agreeing
in the bony coat of mail, and both groups now extinct and
both of uncertain relationship, have been often united under
the name of <i>Placoderms</i>, and these and many other fishes
have been again erroneously confounded with the Ganoids.
Again, the Teleostomi have been frequently divided into three
classes&mdash;<i>Crossopterygii</i>, <i>Dipneusti</i> or <i>Dipnoi</i>, and <i>Actinopterygii</i>.
The latter may be again divided into <i>Ganoidei</i> and <i>Teleostei</i>
and all sorts of ranks have been assigned to each of these
groups. For our purposes a division into eight classes is most
convenient, and lowest among these we may place the <i>Enteropneusta</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Enteropneusta.</b>&mdash;Most simple, most worm-like, and perhaps
most primitive of all the Chordates is the group of
worm-shaped forms, forming the class of <i>Enteropneusta</i>. The
class of <i>Enteropneusta</i>, also called <i>Adelochorda</i> or <i>Hemichordata</i>,
as here recognized, consists of a group of small marine animals
allied to the genus <i>Balanoglossus</i>, or acorn-tongues (&#946;&#8049;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;,
acorn; &#947;&#955;&#8061;&#963;&#963;&#945;, tongue). These are worm-like creatures with
fragile bodies buried in the sand or mud, or living under rocks
of the seashore and in shallow waters, where they lie coiled in a
spiral, with little or no motion. From the surface of the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
a mucous substance is secreted, holding together particles by
which are formed tubes of sand. The animal has a peculiar
odor like that of iodoform. At the front is a long muscular
proboscis, very sensitive, capable of great extension and contraction,
largely used in burrowing in the ground, and of a
brilliant orange color in life. Behind this is a collar which
overlaps the small neck and conceals the small mouth at the
base of the proboscis. The gill-slits behind the collar are also
more or less concealed by it.</p>

<p>The body, which is worm-like, extends often to the length
of two or three feet. The gill-slits in the adult are arranged
in regular pairs, there being upwards of fifty in number much
like the gill-slits of the lancelet. As the animal grows older
the slits become less conspicuous, their openings being reduced
to small slit-like pores.</p>

<p>In the interior of the proboscis is a rod-like structure which
arises as an outgrowth of the alimentary canal above the
mouth. In development and structure this rod so resembles
the notochord of the lancelet that it is regarded as a true
notochord, though found in the anterior region only. From
the presence of gill-slits and notochord and from the development
and structure of the central nervous system <i>Balanoglossus</i>
was recognized by William Bateson, who studied an American
species, <i>Dolichoglossus kowalevskii</i>, at Hampton
Roads in Virginia in 1885, and at Beaufort
in North Carolina, as a member of the
Chordate series. Unlike the Tunicates it
represents a primitively simple, not a degenerate,
type. It seems to possess real affinities
with the worms, or possibly, as some have
thought, with the sea-urchins.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 436px;">
<img src="images/i_463.jpg" width="436" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 275.</span>&mdash;"Tornaria"
Larva of <i>Glossobalanus
minutus</i>. (After Minot.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>A peculiar little creature, known as <i>Tornaria</i>,
was once considered to be the larva
of a starfish. It is minute and transparent,
floating on the surface of the sea. It has no
visible resemblance to the adult <i>Balanoglossus</i>,
but it has been reared in aquaria and shown
to pass into the latter or into the related
genus <i>Glossobalanus</i>. No such metamorphosis was found by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
Bateson in the more primitive genus <i>Dolichoglossus</i>, studied
by him. This adult animal may be, indeed, a worm as it appears,
but the presence of gill-slits, the existence of a rudimentary
notochord, and the character of the central nervous system
are distinctly fish-like and therefore vertebrate characters.
With the Chordates, and not with the worms, this class, <i>Enteropneusta</i>
(&#7956;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;, intestine; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, to breathe), must be placed
if its characters have been rightly interpreted. It is possibly
a descendant of the primitive creatures which marked the
transition from the archaic worms, or possibly archaic Echinoderms,
to the archaic Chordate type.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_464.jpg" width="700" height="268" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 276.</span>&mdash;<i>Glossobalanus minutus</i>, one of the higher Enteropneustans.
(After Minot.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is perhaps not absolutely certain that the notochord of
<i>Balanoglossus</i> and its allies is a true homologue of the
notochord of the lancelet. There may be doubt even of the
homologies of the gill-slits themselves. But the balance of
evidence seems to throw <i>Balanoglossus</i> on the fish side of the
dividing line which separates the lower Chordates from the
worms.</p>

<p>It may be noticed that Hubrecht regards the proboscis
of various marine Nemertine worms as a real homologue of the
notochord, and other writers have traced with more or less
success other apparent or possible homologies between the
Chordate and the Annelid series.</p>

<p><b>Classification of Enteropneusta.</b>&mdash;Until recently the <i>Enteropneusta</i>
have been usually placed in a single family or even in a
single genus. The recent researches of Professor J. W. Spengel
of Giessen and of Professor William Emerson Ritter of the University
of California, have shown clearly that the group is much
larger than had been generally supposed, with numerous species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
in all the warm seas. In Spengel's recent paper, "Die Benennung
der Enteropneusten-Gattungen," three families are recognized
with nine genera and numerous species. At least seven
species are now known from the Pacific Coast of North America.</p>

<p><b>Family Harrimaniid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;In <i>Harrimania maculosa</i>, lately described
by Dr. Ritter from Alaska, the
eggs are large, with much food yolk,
and the process of development is
probably, without <i>Tornaria</i> stage. A
second species of <i>Harrimania</i> (<i>H. kupferi</i>)
is now recognized from Norway
and Greenland. This genus is the simplest
in structure among all the Enteropneustans
and may be regarded as the
lowest of known Chordates, the most
worm-like of back-boned animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_465.jpg" width="700" height="572" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 277.</span>&mdash;<i>Harrimania maculosa</i>
(Ritter), the lowest of
chordate animals. An Enteropneustan
from Alaska.
(After Ritter.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In <i>Dolichoglossus kowalevskii</i> the species studied by Bateson
on the Virginia coast, the same simplicity of development
occurs. This genus, with a third, <i>Stereobalanus</i> (<i>canadensis</i>),
constitutes in Spengel's system the family of <i>Harrimaniid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p><b>Balanoglossid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The family <i>Glandicepitid&aelig;</i> contains the genera
<i>Glandiceps</i>, <i>Spengelia</i>, and <i>Schizocardium</i>. In the <i>Balanoglossid&aelig;</i>
(<i>Ptychoderid&aelig;</i> of Spengel) the eggs are very small and numerous,
with little food yolk. The species in this family pass through
the Tornaria stage above described, a condition strikingly like
that of the larval starfish. This fact has given rise to the
suggestion that the Enteropneusta have a real affinity with the
Echinoderms.</p>

<p>The <i>Balanoglossid&aelig;</i> include the genera <i>Glossobalanus</i>, <i>Balanoglossus</i>,
and <i>Ptychodera</i>, the latter the oldest known member
of the group, its type, <i>Ptychodera flava</i>, having been described
by Eschscholtz from the Pacific Coast in 1825, while <i>Balanoglossus
clavigerus</i> was found by Della Chiaje in 1829.</p>

<p><b>Low Organization of Harrimaniid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;Apparently the <i>Harrimaniid&aelig;</i>,
with simpler structure, more extensive notochord, and
direct development, should be placed at the bottom as the most
primitive of the Enteropneustan series. Dr. Willey, however,
regards its characters as due to degeneration, and considers the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
more elaborate <i>Balanoglossid&aelig;</i> as nearest the primitive type.
The case in this view would have something in common with
that of the <i>Larvacea</i>, which seems to be the primitive Tunicates,
but which may have been produced by the degeneration
of more complex forms.</p>

THE TUNICATES, OR ASCIDIANS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_467.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Structure</span> of Tunicates.</b>&mdash;One of the most singular
groups of animals is that known as Ascidians, or Tunicates.
It is one of the most clearly marked yet most
heterogeneous of all the classes of animals, and in no other are
the phenomena of degeneration so clearly shown.</p>

<p>Among them is a great variety of form and habit. Some
lie buried in sand; some fasten themselves to rocks; some
are imbedded in great colonies in a gelatinous matrix produced
from their own bodies, and some float freely in long
chains in the open sea. All agree in changing very early in
their development from a free-swimming or fish-like condition
to one of quiescence, remaining at rest or drifting with the
current.</p>

<p>Says Dr. John Sterling Kingsley: "Many of the species
start in life with the promise of reaching a point high in the
scale, but after a while they turn around and, as one might
say, pursue a downward course which results in an adult which
displays but few resemblances to the other vertebrates. Indeed,
so different do they seem that the fact that they belong here
was not suspected until about thirty-five years ago. Before
that time, ever since the days of Cuvier, they were almost
universally regarded as mollusks, and many facts were adduced
to show that they belonged near the acephals (clams, oysters,
etc.). In the later years when the facts of development began
to be known, this association was looked on with suspicion,
and by some they were placed for a short time among the worms.
Any one who has watched the phases of their development
cannot help believing that they belong here, the lowest of the
vertebrate series."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>The following account of the structure and development
of the Tunicate is taken, with considerable modification and
condensation, from Professor Kingsley's chapter on the group
in the Riverside Natural History. For the changes suggested
I am indebted to the kindness of Professor William Emerson
Ritter:</p>

<p>The Tunicates derive their name from the fact that the
whole body is invested with a tough envelope or "tunic." This
tunic or test may be either gelatinous, cartilaginous, or leathery.
In some forms it is perfectly transparent, in others it is translucent,
allowing enough light to pass to show the colors of the
viscera, while in still others it is opaque and variously colored.
The tunic is everywhere only loosely attached to the body
proper, except in the region of the two openings now to be
mentioned. One of these openings occupies a more or less
central position, while the other is usually at one side, or it may
even be placed at the opposite end of the body. On placing
one of the Ascidians in a glass dish and sprinkling a little carmine
or indigo in the water, we can study some of the functions
of the animal. As soon as the disturbance is over, the
animals will open the two apertures referred to, when it will
be seen that each is surrounded with blunt lobes, the number
of which varies with the species. As soon as they are opened a
stream of water will be seen to rush into the central opening,
carrying with it the carmine, and a moment later a reddish
cloud will be ejected from the other aperture. From this we
learn that the water passes through the body. Why it does so
is to be our next inquiry. On cutting the animal open we find
that the water, after passing through the first-mentioned opening
(which may be called the mouth) enters a spacious chamber,
the walls of which are made up of fine meshes, the whole
appearing like lattice-work. Taking out a bit of this network
and examining it under the microscope, we find that the edges
of the meshes are armed with strong cilia, which are in constant
motion, forcing the water through the holes. Of course, the
supply has to be made good, and hence more water flows in
through the mouth. This large cavity is known as the branchial
or pharyngeal chamber. It is, according to Professor Ritter,
"as we know from the embryology of the animal, the greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
enlarged anterior end of the digestive tract; and as the holes,
or stigmata, as they are technically called, are perforations of
the wall for the passage of water for purposes of respiration,
they are both morphologically and physiologically comparable
with the gill openings of fishes." There can be no doubt, therefore,
that the pharyngeal sac of Ascidians is homologous with
the pharynx of fishes.</p>

<p>Surrounding the mouth, or branchial orifice, just at its
entrance into the branchial chamber is a circle of tentacles.
These are simple in some genera, but elaborately branched
in others.</p>

<p>In close connection with the cerebral ganglion, which is
situated between the two siphons, there is a large gland with a
short trumpet-shaped duct opening into the branchial sac a
little distance behind the mouth. The orifice of the duct is
just within a ring consisting of a ciliated groove that extends
around the mouth outside the circle of branchial tentacles.
On the opposite side of the mouth from the gland the ciliated
groove joins another groove which is both ciliated and glandular,
and which runs backward along the upper floor of the pharyngeal
sac to its posterior extremity. This organ, called the
endostyle, is concerned in the transportation of the animal's
food through the pharyngeal sac to the opening of the &oelig;sophagus.
Comparative embryology makes it almost certain that
the subneural gland with its duct, described above, is homologous
with the hypophesis cerebri of true vertebrates, and that the
endostyle is homologous with the thyroid glands of vertebrates.</p>

<p>The water after passing through the branchial network is
received into narrow passages and conducted to a larger cavity&mdash;the
cloacal or atrial chamber. The general relations can he
seen from our diagram, illustrating a vertical and horizontal
section. From the atrial chamber the water flows out into the
external world.</p>

<p>Now we can readily see how in the older works naturalists
were misled as to the affinities of the Tunicates. They regarded
the tunic as the equivalent of the mantle of the mollusks,
while the incurrent and excurrent openings corresponded
to the siphons. In one genus, <i>Rhodosoma</i>, the resemblance
was even stronger, for there the tunic is in two parts, united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
by a hinge line, and closed by an adductor muscle. How and
why these views were totally erroneous will be seen when we
come to consider the development of these animals.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the pharnygeal sac is the narrow &oelig;sophagus
surrounded with cilia, which force a current down into the
digestive tract. The branchial meshes serve as a strainer
for the water, and the larger particles which it contains fall
down until they are within reach of the current going down
the &oelig;sophagus. After passing through the throat, they come
to the stomach, where digestion takes place, and then the
ejectamenta are carried out through the intestine and poured
into the bottom of the atrial cavity.</p>

<p>The heart lies on the ventral side of the stomach and is
surrounded by a well-developed pericardium. The most remarkable
fact connected with the circulation is that the heart,
after beating a short time, forcing the blood through the vessels,
will suddenly stop for a moment and then resume its beats;
but, strange to say, after the stoppage the direction of the circulation
is reversed, the blood taking an exactly opposite course
from that formerly pursued. This most exceptional condition
was first seen in the transparent <i>Salpa</i>, but it may be witnessed
in the young of most genera. We have already referred to the
branchial chamber. The walls of this chamber, besides acting
as a strainer, are also respiratory organs. The meshes of which
they are composed are in reality tubes through which the blood
circulates and thus is brought in contact with a constantly
renewed supply of fresh water.</p>

<p>The central nervous system in the adults of all except the
<i>Larvacea</i> is reduced to a single ganglion placed near the mouth
thus indicating the dorsal side. In forms like <i>Cynthia</i> it holds
the same relative position with regard to the mouth, but by
the doubling of the body (to be explained further on) it is
also brought near the atrial aperture, where it is shown in
our first diagram.</p>

<p><b>Development of Tunicates.</b>&mdash;The sexes are combined in the
same individual, though usually the products ripen at different
times. As a rule, the earlier stages of the embryo are passed
inside the cloacal chamber, though in some the development
occurs outside the body. As a type of the development we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
will consider that of one of the solitary forms, leaving the many
curious modifications to be noticed in connection with the
species in which they occur. This will be best, since these
forms show the relationship to the other vertebrates in the clearest
manner.</p>

</div>

<p>The egg undergoes a total segmentation and a regular gastrulation.
Soon a tail appears, and under the microscope
the young embryo, which now begins its free life, appears much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
like the tadpole of the frog. It has a large oval body and a
long tail which lashes about, forcing the animal forward with
a wriggling motion. Nor is the resemblance superficial; it
pervades every part of the structure, as may be seen from the
adjacent diagram. The mouth is nearly terminal and communicates
with a gill-chamber provided with gill-clefts. At
the posterior end of the gill-chamber begins the alimentary
tract, which pursues a convoluted course to the vent. In the
tail, but not extending to any distance into the body, is an
axial cylinder, the notochord, which here, as in all other vertebrates,
arises from the hypoblast; and above it is the spinal
cord (epiblastic in origin), which extends forward to the brain,
above the gill-chamber. Besides, the animal is provided with
organs of sight and hearing, which, however, are of peculiar
construction and can hardly be homologized with the corresponding
organs in vertebrates. So far the correspondence between
the two types is very close, and if we knew nothing about the
later stages, one would without
doubt predict that the adult tunicate
would reach a high point in
the scale of vertebrates. These
high expectations are never fulfilled;
the animal, on the contrary,
pursues a retrograde course, resulting
in an adult whose relationship
to the true vertebrates never
would have been suspected had
its embryology remained unknown.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 279.</span>&mdash;Anatomy of Tunicate.
(After Herdman, per Parker &amp;
Haswell.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>After the stage described this
retrograde movement begins. From
various parts of the body lobes
grow out, armed on their extremities
with sucking-disks. These
soon come in contact with some
subaquatic object and adhere to
it. Then the notochord breaks
down, the spinal cord is absorbed, the tail follows suit, the
intestine twists around, and the cloaca is formed, the result being
much like the diagram near the head of this section. In forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
like <i>Appendicularia</i>, little degeneration takes place, so far as is
known, the tail, with its notochord and neural chord, persisting
through life.</p>

<p><b>Reproduction of Tunicates.</b>&mdash;As to the reproduction of the
Tunicates, Dr. Ritter writes: "In addition to the sexual method
of reproduction, many tunicates reproduce asexually by budding.
The capacity for bud reproduction appears to have been acquired
by certain simple Ascidians in connection with, probably
as a result of, their having given up the free-swimming life
and become attached and consequently degenerate.</p>

<p>"Instructive as the embryonic development of the creatures
is from the standpoint of evolution, the bud method of development
is scarcely less so from the same point of view. The
development of the adult zooid from the simple bud has been
conclusively shown to be by a process in many respects fundamentally
unlike that by which the individual is developed from
the egg. We have then in these animals a case in which practically
the same results are reached by developmental processes
that are, according to prevailing conceptions of animal organizations,
fundamentally different. This fact has hardly a parallel
in the animal kingdom."</p>

<p><b>Habits of Tunicates.</b>&mdash;The Tunicates are all marine, some floating
or swimming freely, some attached to rocks or wharves,
others buried in the sand. They feed on minute organisms,
plants, or animals, occasional rare forms being found in their
stomachs. Some of them possess a single median eye or eye-like
structure which may not do more than recognize the presence
of light. No fossil Tunicates are known, as they possess no
hard parts, although certain Ostracoderms have been suspected,
though on very uncertain grounds, to be mailed Tunicates,
rather than mailed lampreys. It is not likely that this hypothesis
has any sound foundation. The group is divided by Herdman
and most other recent authorities into three orders, viz., the
<i>Larvacea</i>, the <i>Ascidiacea</i>, and the <i>Thaliacea</i>.</p>

<p><b>Larvacea.</b>&mdash;In the most primitive order the animals are
minute and free-swimming, never passing beyond the tadpole
stage. The notochord and the nervous chord persist through
life, the latter with ganglionic segmentations at regular intervals.
The species mostly float in the open sea, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
of them form from their own secretions a transparent gelatinous
envelope called a "house." This has two apertures and a long
chamber "in which the tail has room to vibrate."</p>

<p>The order consists of a single small family, <i>Appendiculariid&aelig;</i>.
The lowest type is known as <i>Kowalevskia</i>, a minute creature
without heart or intestine found floating in the Mediterranean.
It is in many respects the simplest in structure among <i>Chordate</i>
animals. <i>Oikopleura</i> (Fig. 288) is another genus of this group.</p>

<p><b>Ascidiacea.</b>&mdash;In the <i>Ascidiacea</i> the adult is usually attached
to some object, and the two apertures are placed near each
other by the obliteration of the caudal area. The form has
been compared to a "leathern bottle with two spouts."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 363px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 280.</span>&mdash;<i>Ascidia adh&aelig;rens</i>
Ritter. Glacier
Bay, Alaska. (After
Ritter.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The suborder <i>Ascidi&aelig; simplices</i> includes the solitary Ascidians
or "sea-squirts," common on our shores, as well as the
social forms in which an individual is surrounded
by its buds. The common name
arises from the fact that when touched they
contract, squirting water from both apertures.
The <i>Ascidiid&aelig;</i> comprise the most
familiar solitary forms, some of them the
largest of the Tunicates and represented on
most coasts. In the <i>Molgulid&aelig;</i> and most
<i>Ascidi&aelig; composit&aelig;</i> the young hatch out in
the cloaca, from which "these tadpoles
swim out as yellow atoms," while in a new
genus, <i>Euherdmania</i>, described by Ritter,
from the coast of California, the embryos are
retained through their whole larval stage in
the oviduct of the parent. They form, according
to Kingsley, adhesive processes on
the body, but those of <i>Molgula</i> cannot use
them in becoming attached to rocks, since they are entirely inclosed
in a peculiar envelope. This envelope is after a while very
adhesive, and if the little tadpole happens to touch any part
of himself to a stone or shell he is fastened for life. Thus "I
have frequently seen them adhere by the tail, while the anterior
part was making the most violent struggles to escape. Soon,
however, they settle down contentedly, absorb the tail, and
in a few weeks assume the adult structure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p>In the family <i>Cynthiid&aelig;</i> the brightly-colored red and yellow
species of <i>Cynthia</i> are known as sea-peaches by the fishermen.
The sea-pears, <i>Boltenia</i>, are fastened to long stalks. These have
a leathery and wrinkled tunic, to which alg&aelig; and hydroids
freely attach themselves. Into the gill-cavity of these forms
small fishes, blennies, gobies, and pearl-fishes often retreat for
protection.</p>

</div>

<p>The social Ascidians constitute the <i>Clavellinid&aelig;</i>. They are
similar to the <i>Ascidiid&aelig;</i> in form, but each individual sends out
a bud which forms a stern bearing another individual at the
end. By this means large colonies may be formed.</p>

<p>The suborder, <i>Ascidi&aelig; composit&aelig;</i>, contains the compound
Ascidians or colonies enveloped in a common gelatinous "test."
These colonies are usually attached to rock or seaweed, and the
individuals are frequently regularly and symmetrically arranged.
The bodies are sometimes complex in form.</p>

</div>

<p>In the <i>Botryllid&aelig;</i> and <i>Polystyelid&aelig;</i> the individuals are not
segmented and in the former family are arranged in star-shaped
groups about a common cloaca, into which the atrial siphons of
the different individuals open. The group springs by budding
from the tadpole, or larva, which has attached itself to some object.
These forms are often brightly colored. <i>Botryllus gouldi</i> is a
species very common along our North Atlantic coast, forming
gray star-shaped masses sometimes an inch across on eel-grass
(<i>Zostera</i>) and on flat-leaved seaweeds. <i>Goodsiria dura</i>, a representative
of the <i>Polystyelid&aelig;</i>, is one of the most common Ascidians
on the California coast southward, where the brick-red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
masses incrusting on seaweeds of various kinds, and on other
Ascidians, are frequently thrown ashore in great quantities
during heavy storms.</p>

Islands, Alaska. (After Ritter.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In <i>Didemnid&aelig;</i> the body is more complex, of two parts, called
the "thorax" and "abdomen." In <i>Amar&oelig;cium</i>, the "sea
pork" of the fishermen, the body
is in three parts and the individuals
are very long. These sometimes
form great masses a foot or
more long, "colored like boiled
salt pork, but more translucent."
Other families of this type are
the <i>Distomid&aelig;</i> and the <i>Polyclinid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>In the suborder <i>Luci&aelig;</i>, including
the family <i>Pyrosomid&aelig;</i>, the
colonies are thimble-shaped and
hollow, the incurrent openings
being on the outer surface of the
thimble, the outgoing stream opening
within. <i>Pyrosoma</i> is highly
phosphorescent. In the tropical
seas some colonies reach a length
of two or three feet. It is said
that a description of a colony was once written by a naturalist
on a page illumined by the colony's own light. "Each of the
individuals has a number of cells near the mouth the function
of which is to produce the light."</p>

<p><b>Thaliacea.</b>&mdash;In the order <i>Thaliacea</i> the Tunicates have the two
orifices at opposite ends of the body. All are free-swimming
and perfectly transparent. The principal family is that of
<i>Salpid&aelig;</i>. The gill-cavity in Salpa is much altered, the gills
projecting into it dividing it into two chambers.</p>

<p>In these forms we have the phenomena of alternation of
generations. A sexual female produces eggs, and from each
hatches a tadpole larva which is without sex. This gives rise
to buds, some at least of the individuals arising which in
turn produce eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 285.</span>&mdash;<i>Botryllus magnus</i> Ritter. Part of colony. (After Ritter.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the family <i>Salpid&aelig;</i> two kinds of individuals occur, the
solitary salpa, or female, and the chain salpa, or bisexual males.
The latter are united together in long bands, each individual
forming a link in the chain held together by spurs extending
from one to the next. From each solitary individual a long
process or cord grows out, this dividing to form the chain. Each
chain salpa produces male reproductive organs and each develops
as well a single egg. The egg is developed within the
body attached by a sort of placenta, while the spermatozoa
are cast into the sea to fertilize other eggs. From each egg
develops the solitary salpa and from her buds the chain of
bisexual creatures. Dr. W. K. Brooks regards these as nursing
males, the real source of the egg being perhaps the solitary
female. Of this extraordinary arrangement the naturalist-poet
Chamisso, who first described it, said: "A salpa mother
is not like its daughter or its own mother, but resembles its
sister, its granddaughter, and its grandmother." But it is
misleading to apply such terms taken from the individualized
human relationship to the singular communal system developed
by these ultra-degenerate and strangely specialized Chordates.</p>

</div>

<p>The Salpas abound in the warm seas, the chains often covering
the water for miles. They are perfectly transparent,
and the chains are often more than a foot
in length. In Doliolum the body is barrel-shaped
and the gills are less modified than in
Salpa. The alternation of generations in
this genus is still more complicated than in
Salpa, for here we have not only a sexual
and a non-sexual generation, the individuals
of which differ from each other, but there
is further a differentiation among the asexually
produced individuals themselves; so
that we have in all three instead of two sorts
of animals in the complete life cycle. Besides
the proliferating stolon situated on the ventral
side, the bud-producing individual possesses a
dorsal process larger than the stolon proper. The buds become
completely severed from the true stolon at an early stage and
actually crawl along the side of the parent up to the dorsal
process, upon which they arrange themselves in three rows,
two lateral and one median. The buds of the lateral rows
become nutritive and respiratory zooids, while those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
median row, ultimately at least, give rise in turn to the egg-producing
individuals.</p>

<p><b>Origin of Tunicates.</b>&mdash;There can be little doubt that the
<i>Tunicata</i> form an offshoot from the primitive Chordate stock,
and the structure of their larva in connection with that of the
lancelet throws a large light on the nature of their common
parents. "We may conclude," says Dr. Arthur Willey, "that
the proximate ancestor of the Vertebrates was a free-swimming
animal intermediate in organization between an Ascidian tadpole
and Amphioxus, possessing the dorsal mouth, hypophysis,
and restricted notochord of the former and the myotomes,
c&oelig;lomic epithelium, and straight alimentary canal of the latter.
The ultimate or primordial ancestor of the Vertebrates would,
on the contrary, be a worm-like animal whose organization
was approximately on a level with that of the bilateral ancestors
of the Echinoderms."</p>

<i>Appendiculariid&aelig;</i>. (After Fol, per Parker &amp; Haswell.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Degeneration of Tunicates.</b>&mdash;There is no question, furthermore,
Professor Ritter observes, "that most of the group has
undergone great degeneration in its evolutionary course. Just
what the starting-point was, however, is a matter on which
there is considerable difference of opinion among authorities.
According to one view, particularly championed by Professor
W. K. Brooks, <i>Appendicularia</i> is very near the ancestral form.
The ancestor was consequently a small, marine, free-swimming
creature. From this ancestor the Ascidiacea were evolved
largely through the influence of the attached habit of life, and
the tadpole stage in their development is a recapitulation of the
ancestral form, just as the tadpole stage in the frog's life is a
repetition of the fish ancestry of the frog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>"According to the most common view <i>Appendicularia</i> is
not an ancestral form at all, but is the tadpole stage of the
<i>Ascidiacea</i> that has failed to undergo metamorphosis and has
become sexually mature in the larval condition, as the larva
of certain Amphibians and insects are known to never pass
into the adult state but reproduce their kind sexually in the
larval condition. By this view the tadpole of such Ascidian
as <i>Ciona</i>, for example, represents more closely the common
ancestor of the group than does any other form we know. This
view is especially defended by Professor K. Heider and Dr.
Arthur Willey."</p>

THE LEPTOCARDII, OR LANCELETS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_482.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Lancelet.</b>&mdash;The lancelet is a vertebrate reduced to
its very lowest terms. The essential organs of vertebrate
life are there, but each one in its simplest form
unspecialized and with structure and function feebly differentiated.
The skeleton consists of a cartilaginous notochord inclosed
in a membranous sheath. There is no skull. No limbs,
no conspicuous processes, and no vertebr&aelig; are present. The heart
is simply a long contractile tube, hence the name <i>Leptocardii</i>
(from &#955;&#949;&#960;&#964;&#8057;&#962;, slender; &#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#8055;&#945;, heart). The blood is colorless.
There is a hepatic portal circulation. There is no brain, the
spinal cord tapering in front as behind. The water for respiration
passes through very many gill-slits from the pharynx into
the atrium, from which it is excluded through the atripore in
front of the vent. A large chamber, called the atrium, extends
almost the length of the body along the ventral and lateral
regions. It communicates with the pharynx through the gill-slits
and with the exterior through a small opening in front
of the vent, the atripore. The atrium is not found in forms
above the lancelets.</p>

<p>The reproductive organs consist of a series of pairs of segmentally
arranged gonads. The excretory organs consist of
a series of tubules in the region of the pharynx, connecting the
body-cavity with the atrium. The mouth is a lengthwise slit
without jaws, and on either side is a row of fringes. From this
feature comes the name <i>Cirrostomi</i>, from cirrus, a fringe of
hair, and &#963;&#964;&#8057;&#956;&#945;, mouth. The body is lanceolate in form, sharp
at either end. From this fact arises a third name, <i>Amphioxus</i>,
from &#7936;&#956;&#966;&#8055;, both; &#8000;&#958;&#8059;&#962;, sharp. Dorsal and anal fins are developed
as folds of the skin supported by very slender rays.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
There are no other fins. The alimentary canal is straight, and
is differentiated into pharynx and intestine; the liver is a blind
sac arising from the anterior end of the intestine. A pigment
spot in the wall of the spinal cord has been interpreted as an
eye. Above the snout is a supposed olfactory pit which some
have thought to be connected with the pineal structure. The
muscular impressions along the sides are very distinct and it
is chiefly by means of the variation in numbers of these that
the species can be distinguished. Thus in the common lancelet
of Europe, <i>Branchiostoma lanceolatum</i>, the muscular bands
are 35+14+12=61. In the common species of the Eastern
coasts of America, <i>Branchiostoma carib&aelig;um</i>, these are 35+14+9=58,
while in the California lancelet, <i>Branchiostoma californiense</i>,
these are 44+16+9=69.</p>

<p><b>Habits of Lancelets.</b>&mdash;Lancelets are slender translucent worm-like
creatures, varying from half an inch (<i>Asymmetron lucayanum</i>)
to four inches (<i>Branchiostoma californiense</i>) in length.
They live buried in sand in shallow waters along the coasts of
warm seas. One species, <i>Amphioxides pelagicus</i>, has been taken
at the depth of 1000 fathoms, but whether at the bottom
or floating near the surface is not known. The species are very
tenacious of life and will endure considerable mutilation. Some
of them are found on almost every coast in semi-tropical and
tropical regions.</p>

<p><b>Species of Lancelets.</b>&mdash;The Mediterranean species ranges northward
to the south of England. Others are found as far north
as Chesapeake Bay, San Diego, and Misaki in Japan, where is
found a species called <i>Branchiostoma belcheri</i>. The sands at
the mouth of San Diego Bay are noted as producing the largest
of the species of lancelets, <i>Branchiostoma californiense</i>. From
the Bahamas comes the smallest, the type of a distinct genus,
<i>Asymmetron lucayanum</i>, distinguished among other things by
a projecting tail. Other supposed genera are <i>Amphioxides</i>
(<i>pelagicus</i>), dredged in the deep sea off Hawaii and supposed
to be pelagic, the mouth without cirri; <i>Epigonichthys</i> (<i>cultellus</i>),
from the East Indies, and <i>Heteropleuron</i> (<i>bassanum</i>), from Bass
Straits, Australia. These little animals are of great interest
to anatomists as giving the clue to the primitive structure of
vertebrates. While possibly these have diverged widely from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
their actual common ancestry with the fishes, they must approach
near to these in many ways. Their simplicity is largely
primitive, not, as in the Tunicates, the result of subsequent
degradation.</p>

</div>

<p>The lancelets, less than a dozen species in all, constitute a
single family, <i>Branchiostomid&aelig;</i>. The principal genus, <i>Branchiostoma</i>,
is usually called <i>Amphioxus</i> by anatomists. But while
the name <i>Amphioxus</i>, like lancelet, is convenient in vernacular
use, it has no standing in systematic nomenclature. The name
<i>Branchiostoma</i> was given to lancelets from Naples in 1834, by
Costa, while that of <i>Amphioxus</i>, given to specimens from Cornwall,
dates from Yarrell's work on the British fishes in 1836.
The name Amphioxus may be pleasanter or shorter or more
familiar or more correctly descriptive than <i>Branchiostoma</i>, but
if so the fact cannot be considered in science as affecting the
duty of priority.</p>

<p>The name <i>Acraniata</i> (without skull) is often used for the
lower Chordates taken collectively, and it is sometimes applied
to the lancelets alone. It refers to those chordate forms which
have no skull nor brain, as distinguished from the <i>Craniota</i>,
or forms with a distinct brain having a bony or cartilaginous
capsule for its protection.</p>

<p><b>Origin of Lancelets.</b>&mdash;It is doubtless true, as Dr. Willey suggests,
that the Vertebrates became separated from their worm-like
ancestry through "the concentration of the central nervous
system along the dorsal side of the body and its conversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
into a hollow tube." Besides this trait two others are common
to all of them, the presence of the gill-slits and that of the notochord.
The gill-slits may have served primarily to relieve the
stomach of water, as in the lowest forms they enter directly into
the body-cavity. The primitive function of the notochord is
still far from clear, but its ultimate use of its structures in
affording protection and in furnishing a fulcrum for the muscles
and limbs is of the greatest importance in the processes of life.</p>

THE CYCLOSTOMES, OR LAMPREYS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_486.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Lampreys.</b>&mdash;Passing upward from the lancelets and
setting aside the descending series of Tunicates, we
have a long step indeed to the next class of fish-like
vertebrates. During the period this great gap represents in
time we have the development of brain, skull, heart, and other
differentiated organs replacing the simple structures found in
the lancelet.</p>

<p>The presence of brain without limbs and without coat-of-mail
distinguishes the class of <i>Cyclostomes</i>, or lampreys (&#954;&#965;&#954;&#955;&#8057;&#962;,
round; &#963;&#964;&#8057;&#956;&#945;, mouth). This group is also known as <i>Marsipobranchi</i>
(&#956;&#945;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#960;&#8055;&#959;&#957;, pouch; &#946;&#961;&#8049;&#947;&#967;&#959;&#962;, gill); <i>Dermopteri</i> (&#948;&#8051;&#961;&#956;&#945;,
skin; &#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#957;, fin); and <i>Myzontes</i> (&#956;&#965;&#950;&#8049;&#969;, to suck). It includes
the forms known as lampreys, slime-eels, and hagfishes.</p>

<p><b>Structure of the Lamprey.</b>&mdash;Comparing a Cyclostome with a
lancelet we may see many evidences of specialization in structure.
The Cyclostome has a distinct head with a cranium
formed of a continuous body of cartilage modified to contain a
fish-like brain, a cartilaginous skeleton of which the cranium
is evidently a differentiated part. The vertebr&aelig; are undeveloped,
the notochord being surrounded by its membranes, without
bony or cartilaginous segments. The gills have the form of
fixed sacs, six to fourteen in number, on each side, arranged
in a cartilaginous structure known as "branchial basket" (fig.
289<i>a</i>), the elements of which are not clearly homologous with the
gill-arches of the true fishes. Fish-like eyes are developed on the
sides of the head. There is a median nostril associated with
a pituitary pouch, which pierces the skull floor. An ear-capsule
is developed. The brain is composed of paired ganglia in
general appearance resembling the brain of the true fish, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
the detailed homology of its different parts offers considerable
uncertainty. The heart is modified to form two pulsating
cavities, auricle and ventricle. The folds of the dorsal and
anal fins are distinct, supported by slender rays.</p>

<p>The mouth is a roundish disk, with rasping teeth over its
surface and with sharper and stronger teeth on the tongue.
The intestine is straight and simple. The kidney is represented
by a highly primitive pronephros and no trace exists of an
air-bladder or lung. The skin is smooth and naked, sometimes
secreting an excessive quantity of slime.</p>

<p>From the true fishes the Cyclostomes differ in the total
absence of limbs and of shoulder and pelvic girdles, as well as
of jaws. It has been thought by some writers that the limbs
were ancestrally present and lost through degeneration, as in
the eels. Dr. Ayers, following Huxley, finds evidence of the
ancestral existence of a lower jaw. The majority of observers,
however, regard the absence of limbs and jaws in Cyclostomes
as a primitive character, although numerous other features
of the modern hagfish and lamprey may have resulted from
degeneration. There is no clear evidence that the class of
Cyclostomes, as now known to us, has any great antiquity, and
its members may be all degenerate offshoots from types of
greater complexity of structure.</p>

<p><b>Supposed Extinct Cyclostomes.</b>&mdash;No species belonging to the class
of Cyclostomes has been found fossil. We may reason theoretically
that the earliest fish-like forms were acraniate or lancelet-like,
and that lamprey-like forms would naturally follow these,
but this view cannot be substantiated from the fossils. Lancelets
have no hard parts whatever, and could probably leave
no trace in any sedimentary deposit. The lampreys stand
between lancelets and sharks. Their teeth and fins at least might
occasionally be preserved in the rocks, but no structures certainly
known to be such have yet been recognized. It is however
reasonably certain that the modern lamprey and hagfish
are descendants, doubtless degraded and otherwise modified from
species which filled the gap between the earliest chordate animals
and the jaw-bearing sharks.</p>

<p><b>Conodontes.</b>&mdash;Certain structures found as fossils have been
from time to time regarded as Cyclostomes, but in all such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
cases there is doubt as to the real nature of the fossil relic
in question or as to the proper interpretation of its relationship.</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Conodontes</i> of the Cambrian, Silurian, and Devonian
have been regarded as lingual teeth of extinct Cyclostomes.
The <i>Cycli&aelig;</i> of the Devonian
have been considered as minute
lampreys, although the vertebral
segments are highly specialized,
to a degree far beyond the
condition seen in the lampreys
of to-day. The Ostracophores
have been regarded as monstrous
lampreys in coat of
mail, and the possibility of a
lamprey origin even for Arthrodires
has been suggested. The <i>Cycli&aelig;</i> and <i>Ostracophori</i> were
apparently without jaws or limbs, being in this regard like
the <i>Cyclostomes</i>, but their ancestry and relationships are wholly
problematical.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 290.</span>&mdash;<i>Polygnathus dubium</i> Hinde.
A Conodont from the New York Devonian.
(After Hinde.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The nature of the Conodontes is still uncertain. In form
they resemble teeth, but their structure is different from that
of the teeth of any fishes, agreeing with that of the teeth of
annelid worms. Some have compared them to the armature
of Trilobites. Some fifteen nominal genera are described by
Pander in Russia, and by Hinde about Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario. Some of these, as <i>Drepaniodus</i>, are simple, straight
or curved grooved teeth or tooth-like structures; others, as
<i>Prioniodus</i>, have numerous smaller teeth or denticles at the
base of the larger one.</p>

<p><b>Orders of Cyclostomes.</b>&mdash;The known Cyclostomes are naturally
divided into two orders, the <i>Hyperotreta</i>, or hagfishes, and
the <i>Hyperoartia</i>, or lampreys. These two orders are very distinct
from each other. While the two groups agree in the general
form of the body, they differ in almost every detail, and there is
much pertinence in Lankester's suggestions that each should
stand as a separate class. The ancestral forms of each, as well
as the intervening types if such ever existed, are left unrecorded
in the rocks.</p>

<p><b>The Hyperotreta, or Hagfishes.</b>&mdash;The <i>Hyperotreta</i> (&#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8180;&#945;, pal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>ate;
&#964;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8057;&#962;, perforate), or hagfishes, have the nostril highly
developed, a tube-like cylinder with cartilaginous rings penetrating
the palate. In these the eyes are little developed and
the species are parasitic on other fishes. In <i>Polistotrema stouti</i>,
the hagfish of the coast of California, is parasitic on large fishes,
rockfishes, or flounders. It usually fastens itself at the throat
or isthmus of its host and sometimes at the eyes. Thence it
works very rapidly to the inside of the body. It there devours
all the muscular part of the fish without breaking the skin or
the peritoneum, leaving the fish a living hulk of head, skin, and
bones. It is especially destructive to fishes taken in gill-nets.
The voracity of the Chilean species <i>Polistotrema dombeyi</i> is equally
remarkable. Dr. Federico T. Delfin finds that in seven hours a
hagfish of this species will devour eighteen times its own weight
of fish-flesh. The intestinal canal is a simple tube, through
which most of the food passes undigested. The eggs are large,
each in a yellowish horny case, at one end of which are barbed
threads by which they cling together and to kelp or other objects.
In the California hagfish, <i>Polistotrema stouti</i>, great numbers of
these eggs have been found in the stomachs of the males.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_489.jpg" width="700" height="267" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 291.</span>&mdash;California Hagfish, <i>Polistotrema stouti</i> Lockington.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Similar habits are possessed by all the species in the two
families, <i>Myxinid&aelig;</i> and <i>Eptatretid&aelig;</i>. In the <i>Myxinid&aelig;</i> the
gill-openings are apparently single on each side, the six gills
being internal and leading by six separate ducts to each of
the six branchial sacs. The skin is excessively slimy, the extensible
tongue is armed with two cone-like series of strong
teeth. About the mouth are eight barbels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p>

<p>Of <i>Myxine</i>, numerous species are known&mdash;<i>Myxine glutinosa</i>,
in the north of Europe; <i>Myxine limosa</i>, of the West Atlantic;
<i>Myxine australis</i>, and several others about Cape Horn, and
<i>Myxine garmani</i> in Japan. All live in deep waters and none
have been fully studied. It has been claimed that the hagfish
is male when young, many individuals gradually changing to
female, but this conclusion lacks verification and is doubtless
without foundation.</p>

<p>In the <i>Eptatretid&aelig;</i> the gill-openings, six to fourteen in number,
are externally separate, each with its own branchial sac as in
the lampreys.</p>

<p>The species of the genus <i>Eptatretus</i> (<i>Bdellostoma</i>, <i>Heptatrema</i>,
and <i>Homea</i>, all later names for the same group) are found only
in the Pacific, in California, Chile, Patagonia, South Africa, and
Japan. In general appearance and habits these agree with the
species of <i>Myxine</i>. The species with ten to fourteen gill-openings
(<i>dombeyi</i>: <i>stouti</i>) are sometimes set off as a distinct genus (<i>Polistotrema</i>),
but in other regards the species differ little, and frequent
individual variations occur. <i>Eptatretus burgeri</i> is found
in Japan and <i>Eptatretus forsteri</i> in Australia.</p>

<p><b>The Hyperoartia, or Lampreys.</b>&mdash;In the order <i>Hyperoartia</i>, or
lampreys, the single nostril is a blind sac which does not penetrate
the palate. The seven gill-openings lead each to a separate
sac, the skin is not especially covered with mucus, the eyes
are well developed in the adult, and the mouth is a round disk
armed with rasp-like teeth, the comb-like teeth on the tongue
being less developed than in the hagfishes. The intestine in
the lampreys has a spiral valve. The eggs are small and are
usually laid in brooks away from the sea, and in most cases the
adult lamprey dies after spawning. According to Thoreau, "it
is thought by fishermen that they never return, but waste
away and die, clinging to rocks and stumps of trees for an indefinite
period, a tragic feature in the scenery of the river-bottoms
worthy to be remembered with Shakespeare's description of
the sea-floor." This account is not far from the truth, as recent
studies have shown.</p>

<p>The lampreys of the northern regions constitute the family
of <i>Petromyzonid&aelig;</i>. The larger species (<i>Petromyzon</i>, <i>Entosphenus</i>)
live in the sea, ascending rivers to spawn, and often becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
land-locked and reduced in size by living in rivers only. Such
land-locked marine lampreys (<i>Petromyzon marinus unicolor</i>) breed
in Cayuga Lake and other lakes in New York. The marine forms
reach a length of three feet. Smaller lampreys of other genera
six inches to eighteen inches in length remain all their lives in
the rivers, ascending the little brooks in the spring, clinging to
stones and clods of earth till their eggs are deposited. These
are found throughout northern Europe, northern Asia, and
the colder parts of North America, belonging to the genera
<i>Lampetra</i> and <i>Ichthyomyzon</i>. Other and more aberrant genera
from Chile and Australia are <i>Geotria</i> and <i>Mordacia</i>, the latter
forming a distinct family, <i>Mordaciid&aelig;</i>. In <i>Geotria</i>, a large and
peculiar gular pouch is developed at the throat. In <i>Macrophthalmia</i>
<i>chilensis</i> from Chile the eyes are large and conspicuous.</p>

<p><b>Food of Lampreys.</b>&mdash;The lampreys feed on the blood and flesh
of fishes. They attach themselves to the sides of the various
species, rasp off the flesh with their teeth, sucking the blood
till the fish weakens and dies. Preparations made by students
of Professor Jacob Reighard in the University of Michigan show
clearly that the lamprey stomach contains muscular tissue as well
as the blood of fishes. The river species do a great deal of mischief,
a fact which has been the subject of a valuable investigation
by Professor H. A. Surface, who has also considered the
methods available for their destruction. The flesh of the lamprey
is wholesome, and the larger species, especially the great
sea lamprey of the Atlantic, <i>Petromyzon marinus</i>, are valued as
food. The small species, according to Prof. Gage, never feed on
fishes.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 292.</span>&mdash;Lamprey, <i>Petromyzon marinus</i> L. Woods Hole, Mass.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Metamorphosis of Lampreys.</b>&mdash;All lampreys, so far as known,
pass through a distinct metamorphosis. The young, known as
the <i>Ammoc&oelig;tes</i> form, are slender, eyeless, and with the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
narrow and toothless. From Professor Surface's paper on "The
Removal of Lampreys from the Interior Waters of New York"
we have the following extracts (slightly condensed):</p>

</div>

<p>"In the latter part of the fall the young lampreys, <i>Petromyzon
marinus unicolor</i>, the variety land-locked in the lakes
of Central New York, metamorphose and assume the form of
the adult. They are now about six or eight inches long. The
externally segmented condition of the body disappears. The
eyes appear to grow out through the skin and become plainly
visible and functional. The mouth is no longer filled with vertical
membranous sheets to act as a sieve, but it contains nearly
one hundred and fifty sharp and chitinous teeth, arranged in
rows that are more or less concentric and at the same time
presenting the appearance of circular radiation. These teeth
are very strong, with sharp points, and in structure each has
the appearance of a hollow cone of chitin placed over another
cone or papilla. A little below the center of the mouth is the
oral opening, which is circular and contains a flattened tongue
which bears finer teeth of chitin set closely together and arranged
in two interrupted (appearing as four) curved rows extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
up and down from the ventral toward the dorsal side of the
mouth. Around the mouth is a circle of soft membrane finally
surrounded by a margin of fimbri&aelig; or small fringe. This completes
the apparatus with which the lamprey attaches itself
to its victims, takes its food, carries stones, builds and tears
down its nest, seizes its mate, holds itself in position in a strong
current, and climbs over falls."</p>

<p><b>Mischief Done by Lampreys.</b>&mdash;"The most common economic
feature in the entire life history of these animals is their feeding
habits in this (spawning) stage, their food now consisting wholly
of the blood (and flesh) of fishes. A lamprey is able to strike
its suctorial mouth against a fish, and in an instant becomes so
firmly attached that it is very rarely indeed that the efforts of
the fish will avail to rid itself of its persecutor. When a lamprey
attaches itself to a person's hand in the aquarium, it can
only be freed by lifting it from the water. As a rule it will drop
the instant it is exposed to the open air, although often it will
remain attached for some time even in the open air, or may
attach itself to an object while out of water.</p>

<p>"Nearly all lampreys that are attached to fish when they
are caught in nets will escape through the meshes of the nets,
but some are occasionally brought ashore and may hang on
to their victim with bulldog pertinacity.</p>

<p>"The fishes that are mostly attacked are of the soft-rayed
species, having cycloid scales, the spiny-rayed species with
ctenoid scales being most nearly immune from their attacks.
We think there may be three reasons for this: 1st, the fishes
of the latter group are generally more alert and more active
than those of the former, and may be able more readily to dart
away from such enemies; 2d, their scales are thicker and stronger
and appear to be more firmly imbedded in the skin, consequently
it is more difficult for the lampreys to hold on and cut through
the heavier coat-of-mail to obtain the blood of the victim;
3d, since the fishes of the second group are wholly carnivorous
and in fact almost exclusively fish-eating when adult, in every
body of water they are more rare than those of the first group,
which are more nearly omnivorous. According to the laws
and requirements of nature the fishes of the first group must
be more abundant, as they become the food for those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
second, and it is on account of their greater abundance that
the lampreys' attacks on them are more observed.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that the bullhead, or horned pout (<i>Ameiurus
nebulosus</i>), is by far the greatest sufferer from lamprey
attacks in Cayuga Lake. This may be due in part to the sluggish
habits of the fish, which render it an easy victim, but it
is more likely due to the fact that this fish has no scales and
the lamprey has nothing to do but to pierce the thick skin and
find its feast of blood ready for it. There is no doubt of the
excellency of the bullhead as a food-fish and of its increasing
favor with mankind. It is at present the most important
food- and market-fish of the State (New York), being caught
by bushels in the early part of June when preparing to spawn.
As we have observed at times more than ninety per cent. of
the catch attacked by lampreys, it can readily be seen how
very serious are the attacks of this terrible parasite which is
surely devastating our lakes and streams."</p>

<p><b>Migration or "Running" of Lampreys.</b>&mdash;"After thus feeding
to an unusual extent, their reproductive elements (gonads) become
mature and their alimentary canals commence to atrophy.
This duct finally becomes so occluded that from formerly being
large enough to admit a lead-pencil of average size when forced
through it, later not even liquids can pass through, and it
becomes nearly a thread closely surrounded by the crowding
reproductive organs. When these changes commence to ensue,
the lampreys turn their heads against the current and set out
on their long journeys to the sites that are favorable for spawning,
which here may be from two to eight miles from the lake.
In this migration they are true to their instincts and habits
of laziness in being carried about, as they make use of any available
object, such as a fish, boat, etc., that is going in their direction,
fastening to it with their suctorial mouths and being
borne along at their ease. During this season it is not infrequent
that as the Cornell crews come in from practice and lift
their shells from the water, they find lampreys clinging to the
bottoms of the boats, sometimes as many as fifty at one time.
They are likely to crowd up all streams flowing into the lake,
inspecting the bed of the stream as they go. They do not
stop until they reach favorable spawning sites, and if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
find unsurmountable obstacles in their way, such as vertical
falls or dams, they turn around and go down-stream until they
find another, up which they go. This is proved every spring
by the number of adult lampreys which are seen temporarily
in Pall Creek and Cascadilla Creek. In each of these streams,
about a mile from its mouth, there is a vertical fall over
thirty feet in height which the lampreys cannot surmount, and
in fact they have never been seen attempting to do so. After
clinging with their mouths to the stones at the foot of the
falls for a few days, they work their way down-stream, carefully
inspecting all the bottom for suitable spawning sites.
They do not spawn in these streams because there are too many
rocks and no sand, but finally enter the only stream (the Cayuga
Lake inlet) in which they find suitable and accessible spawning
sites.</p>

</div>

<p>"The three-toothed lampreys (<i>Entosphenus tridentatus</i>) of
the West Coast climb low falls or rapids by a series of leaps,
holding with their mouths to rest, then jumping and striking
again and holding, thus leap by leap gaining the entire distance.</p>

<p>"The lampreys here have never been known to show any
tendency or ability to climb, probably because there are no
rapids or mere low falls in the streams up which they would
run. In fact, as the inlet is the only stream entering Cayuga
Lake in this region which presents suitable spawning conditions
and no obstructions, it can be seen at once that all the
lampreys must spawn in this stream and its tributaries.</p>

<p>"In 'running' they move almost entirely at night, and if
they do not reach a suitable spawning site by daylight, they
will cling to roots or stones during the day and complete their
journey the next night. This has been proven by the positive
observation of individuals. Of the specimens that run up
early in the season, about four-fifths are males. Thus the
males do not exactly precede the females, because we have
found the latter sex represented in the stream as early in the
season as the former, but in the earlier part of the season the
number of the males certainly greatly predominates. This proportion
of males gradually decreases, until in the middle of
the spawning season the sexes are about equally represented,
and toward the latter part of the season the females continue
to come until they in turn show the greater numbers. Thus
it appears very evident in general that the reproductive instinct
impels the most of the males to seek the spawning ground
before the most of the females do. However, it should be said
that neither the males nor the females show all of the entirely
sexually mature features when they first run up-stream in the
beginning of the season, but later they are perfectly mature
and 'ripe' in every regard when they first appear in the stream.
When they migrate, they stop at the site that seems to suit their
fancy, many stopping near the lake, others pushing on four
or five miles farther up-stream. We have noted, however,
that later in the season the lower courses become more crowded,
showing that the late comers do not attempt to push up-stream
as far as those that came earlier. Also it thus follows, from
what was just said about late-running females, that in the latter
part of the season the lower spawning beds are especially crowded
with females. In fact, during the early part of the month of
June we have found, not more than half a mile above the lowest
spawning bed, as many as five females on a spawning nest with
but one male; and in that immediate vicinity many nests
indeed were found at that time with two or three females and
but one male.</p>

<p>"Having arrived at a shoal which seems to present suitable
conditions for a spawning nest, the individual or pair commences
at once to move stones with its mouth from the centre to the
margin of an area one or two feet in diameter. When many
stones are thus placed, especially at the upper edge, and they
are cleaned quite free of sediment and alg&aelig;, both by being
moved and by being fanned with the tail, and when the proper
condition of sand is found in the bottom of the basin thus formed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
it is ready to be used as a spawning bed or nest. A great many
nests are commenced and deserted. This has been left as a
mystery in publications on the subject, but we are well convinced
that it is because the lampreys do not find the requisites
or proper conditions of bottom (rocks, sand, etc., as given
below) to supply all their needs and fulfill all conditions for
ideal sites. This desertion of half-constructed nests is just what
would be expected and anticipated in connection with the explanation
of 'Requisite Conditions for Spawning,' given below,
because some shallows contain more sand and fewer stones, and
others contain many larger stones but no sand, while others
contain pebbles lying over either rocks or sand. The lampreys
remove some of the material, and if they do not find all the
essentials for a spawning nest, the site is deserted and the
creatures move on."</p>

<p><b>Requisite Conditions for Spawning with Lampreys.</b>&mdash;"For a
spawning site two conditions are immediately essential&mdash;proper
conditions of water and suitable stream bed or bottom. Of
course with these it is essential that no impassable barriers
(dam or falls) exist between the lake and the spawning sites
to prevent migration at the proper 'running' season. Lampreys
will not spawn where there is no sand lying on the bottom
between the rocks, as sand is essential in covering the eggs
(see remarks on the 'Spawning Process'); neither will they
spawn where the bottom is all sand and small gravel, as they
cannot take hold of this material with their mouths to construct
nests or to hold themselves in the current, and they
would not find here pebbles and stones to carry over the nest
while spawning, as described elsewhere. It can thus be seen
that, as suggested above, the reason they do not spawn in
Fall Creek and Cascadilla Creek, between the lake and the
falls, is that the beds of these streams are very rocky, being
covered only with large stones and no sand. There is no doubt
that the lampreys find here suitable conditions of water, but
they do not remain to spawn on account of the absence of the
proper conditions of stream bed. Again, they do not spawn
in the lower course of the inlet for a distance of nearly two
miles from the lake, because near the lake the bed of the stream
is composed of silt, while for some distance above this (up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>-stream)
there is nothing but sand. Farther up-stream are
found pebbles and stones commingled with sand, which combination
satisfies the demands of the lampreys for material
in constructing nests and covering eggs. The accessibility
of these sites, together with their suitable conditions, render
the inlet the great and perhaps the only spawning stream of
the lake; and, doubtless, all the mature lampreys come here
to spawn, excepting a few which spawn in the lower part of
Six-mile Creek, a tributary of the inlet.</p>

<p>"As the course of the stream where the beds abound is
divided into pools, separated by stony ripples or shallows, the
nests must be made at the ends of the pools. Of the spawning
beds personally observed during several seasons, nine-tenths
of the entire number were formed just above the shallows at
the lower ends of the pools, while only a few were placed below
them. An advantage in forming the nest above the shoals
rather than below it is that in the former place the water runs
more swiftly over the lower and middle parts of such a bed
than at its upper margin, since the velocity decreases in either
direction from the steeper part of the shallows; and any organic
material or sediment that would wash over the upper edge
of the nest is thus carried on rather than left as a deposit. When
formed below the shallows, owing to the decreased velocity
at the lower part of the nest compared with that at the upper,
the sediment is likely to settle in the hollow of the nest, and,
through the process of decay of the organic material, prove
disastrous or unfavorable for the developing embryos.</p>

<p>"The necessity of sand in the spawning bed indicates the
explanation of why we see so many shallows which have no
spawning lampreys upon them, while there are others in the
same vicinity that are crowded. There will be no nests formed
if there is too little or too much sand, not enough or too many
stones, or stones that are all too small or all too large. The
stones must vary from the size of an egg to the size of a man's
hand, and must be intermingled with sand without mud or
rubbish.</p>

<p>"The lampreys choose to make their spawning nests just
where the water flows so swiftly that it will carry the sand a
short distance, but will not sweep it out of the nest. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
condition furnishes not only force to wash the sand over the
eggs when laid, but also keeps the adult lampreys supplied
with an abundance of fresh water containing the dissolved
air needed for their very rapid respiration. Of course in such
rapid water the eggs are likely to be carried away down-stream,
but Nature provides against this by the fact that they are adhesive,
and the mating lampreys stir up the sand with their
tails, thus weighing down the freshly laid eggs and holding
them in the nest. Hence the necessity of an abundance of
sand at the spawning site."</p>

<p><b>The Spawning Process with Lampreys.</b>&mdash;"There is much interest
in the study of the spawning process, as it is for the maintenance
of the race that the lampreys risk and end their lives;
and as they are by far the lowest form of vertebrates found
within the United States, a consideration of their actions and
apparent evidences of instinct becomes of unusual attraction.
Let us consider one of those numerous examples in which the
male migrates before the female. When he comes to that
portion of the stream where the conditions named above are
favorable, he commences to form a nest by moving and clearing
stones and making a basin with a sandy bottom about the
size of a common wash-bowl. Several nests may be started
and deserted before perfect conditions are found for the completion
of one. The male may be joined by a female either
before or after the nest is completed. There is at once harmony
in the family; but if another male should attempt to intrude,
either before or after the coming of the female, he is likely
to be summarily dealt with and dismissed at once by the first
tenant. As soon as the female arrives she too commences
to move pebbles and stones with her mouth.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the nest is made large enough to contain several
pairs, or often unequal numbers of males and females; or they
may be constructed so closely together as to form one continuous
ditch across the stream, just above the shallows. Many
stones are left at the sides and especially at the upper margin
of the nest, and to these both lampreys often cling for a few
minutes as though to rest. While the female is thus quiet,
the male seizes her with his mouth at the back of her head,
clinging as to a fish. He presses his body as tightly as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
against her side, and loops his tail over her near the vent and
down against the opposite side of her body so tightly that the
sand, accidentally coming between them, often wears the skin
entirely off of either or both at the place of closest contact. In
most observed instances the male pressed against the right
side of the female, although there is no unvarying rule as to
position. The pressure of the male thus aids to force the eggs
from the body of the female, which flow very easily when ripe.
The vents of the two lampreys are thus brought into close
proximity, and the conspicuous genital papilla of the male
serves to guide the milt directly to the issuing spawn. There
appears to be no true intromission, although definite observation
of this feature is quite difficult, and, in fact, impossible.
During the time of actual pairing, which lasts but a few seconds,
both members of the pair exhibit tremendous excitement,
shaking their bodies in rapid vibrations and stirring up such a
cloud of sand with their tails that their eggs are at once concealed
and covered. As the eggs are adhesive and non-buoyant,
the sand that is stirred up adheres to them immediately and
covers most of them before the school of minnows in waiting
just below the nest can dart through the water and regale
themselves upon the eggs of these enemies of their race; but
woe to the eggs that are not at once concealed. We would
suggest that the function of the characteristic anal fin, which
is possessed only by the female, and only at this time of year,
may be to aid in this vastly important process of stirring up
the sand as the eggs are expelled; and the explanation of the
absence of such a fin from the ventral side of the tail of the
male may be found in the fact that it could not be used for
the same purpose at the instant when most needed, since the
male is just then using his tail as a clasping organ to give him
an essential position in pairing. As soon as they shake together
they commence to move stones from one part of the nest to
another, to bring more loose sand down over their eggs. They
work at this from one to five minutes, then shake again, thus
making the intervals between mating from one to five minutes,
with a general average of about three and a half minutes.</p>

<p>"Although their work of moving stones does not appear to
be systematic in reference to the placing of the pebbles, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
as viewed from the standpoint of man, it does not need to be so
in order to perfectly fulfill all the purposes of the lampreys.
As shown above in the remarks on the spawning habits of the
brook lampreys, the important end which they thus accomplish
is the loosening and shifting of the sand to cover their eggs;
and the more the stones are moved, even in the apparently
indiscriminate manner shown, the better is this purpose achieved.
Yet, in general, they ultimately accomplish the feat of moving
to the lower side of the nest all the stones they have placed
or left at the upper margin. At the close of the spawning
season when the nest is seen with no large pebbles at its upper
margin, but quite a pile of stones below, it can be known that
the former occupants completed their spawning process there;
but if many small stones are left at the upper edge and at the
sides, and a large pile is not formed at the lower edge, it can
be known that the nest was forsaken or the lampreys removed
before the spawning process was completed. The stones they
move are often twice as heavy as themselves, and are sometimes
even three or four times as heavy. Since they are not
attempting to build a stone wall of heavy material, there is no
occasion for their joining forces to remove stones of extraordinary
size, and they rarely do so, although once during the
past spring (1900) we saw two lake lampreys carrying the
same large stone down-stream across their nest. Although
this place was occupied by scores of brook lampreys, there
were but three pairs of lake lampreys seen here. It is true
that one of these creatures often moves the same stone several
times, and many even attempt many times to move a stone
that has already been found too heavy for it; but sooner or
later the rock may become undermined so that the water will
aid them, and they have no way of knowing what they can
do under such circumstances until they try. Also, the repeated
moving of one stone may subserve the same purpose
for the lamprey in covering its eggs with sand as would the
less frequent removal of many.</p>

<p>"When disturbed on the spawning nest, either of the pair
will return to the same nest if its mate is to be found there;
but if its mate is in another place, it will go to it, and if its
mate is removed or killed, it is likely to go to any part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
stream to another nest. When disturbed, they often start
up-stream for a short distance, but soon dart down-stream with
a velocity that is almost incredible. They can swim faster
than the true fishes, and after they get a start are generally
pretty sure to make good their escape, although we have seen
them dart so wildly and frantically down-stream that they
would shoot clear out on the bank and become an easy victim
of the collector. This peculiar kind of circumstance is most
likely to happen with those lampreys that are becoming blinded
from long exposure to the bright light over the clear running
water. If there is a solitary individual on a nest when disturbed,
it may not return to that nest, but to any that has
been started, or it may stay in the deep pool below the shallows
until evening and then move some distance up-stream. When
the nest is large and occupied by several individuals, those
that are disturbed may return to any other such nest. We
have never seen evidence of one female driving another female
out of a spawning-nest; and from the great number of nests
in which we have found the numbers of the females exceeding
those of the males, we would be led to infer that the former
live together in greater harmony than do the males.</p>

<p>"Under the subject of the number of eggs laid, we should
have said that at one shake the female spawns from twenty
to forty. We once caught in fine gauze twenty-eight eggs from
a female at one spawning instant. In accordance with the
frequency of spawning stated, and the number of eggs contained
in the body of one female, the entire length of time given to the
spawning process would be from two to four days. This agrees
with the observed facts, although the lampreys spend much
time in moving stones and thoroughly covering the nests with
sand. Even after the work of spawning and moving stones
is entirely completed, they remain clinging to rocks in various
parts of the stream, until they are weakened by fungus and
general debility, when they gradually drift down-stream.</p>

<p>"In forming nests there is a distinct tendency to utilize
those sites that are concealed by overhanging bushes, branches,
fallen tree-tops, or grass or weeds, probably not only for concealment,
but also to avoid the bright sunlight, which sooner
or later causes them to go blind, as it does many fishes when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
they have to live in water without shade. Toward the end of
the spawning season, it is very common to see blind lampreys
clinging helplessly to any rocks on the bottom, quite unable
to again find spawning-beds. However, at such times they are
generally spent and merely awaiting the inevitable end.</p>

<p>"As with the brook lamprey, the time of spawning and
duration of the nesting period depend upon the temperature
of the water, as does also the duration of the period of hatching
or development of the embryo. They first run up-stream when
the water reaches a temperature of 45&deg; or 48&deg; Fahr., and commence
spawning at about 50&deg;. A temperature of 60&deg; finds the
spawning process in its height, and at 70&deg; it is fairly completed.
It is thus that the rapidity with which the water becomes
heated generally determines the length of time the lampreys
remain in the stream. This may continue later in the season
for those that run later, but usually it is about a month or
six weeks from the time the first of this species is seen on a
spawning-nest until the last is gone."</p>

<p><b>What becomes of Lampreys after Spawning?</b>&mdash;"There has been
much conjecture as to the final end of the lampreys, some writers
contending that they die after spawning, others that they return
to deep water and recuperate, and yet others compromise
these two widely divergent views by saying that some die and
others do not. The fact is that the spawning process completely
wears out the lampreys, and leaves them in a physical condition
from which they could never recover. They become
stone-blind; the alimentary canal suffers complete atrophy;
their flesh becomes very green from the katabolic products,
which find the natural outlet occluded; they lose their rich
yellow color and plump, symmetrical appearance; their skin
becomes torn, scratched, and worn off in many places, so that
they are covered with sores, and they become covered with a
parasitic or sarcophytic fungus, which forms a dense mat over
almost their entire bodies, and they are so completely debilitated
and worn out that recovery is entirely out of the question.
What is more, the most careful microscopical examination of
ovaries and testes has failed to reveal any evidence of new
gonads or reproductive bodies. This is proof that reproduction
could not again ensue without a practical rebuilding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
the animals, even though they should regain their vitality.
A. Mueller, in 1865, showed that all the ova in the lamprey
were of the same size, and that after spawning no small reproductive
bodies remained to be developed later. This is
strong evidence of death after once spawning.</p>

<p>"One author writes that an argument against the theory
of their dying after spawning can be found in the fact that so
few dead ones have been found by him. However, many can
be found dead if the investigator only knows how and where
to look for them. We should not anticipate finding them in
water that is shallow enough for the bottom to be plainly seen,
as there the current is strong enough to move them. It is
in the deep, quiet, pools where sediment is depositing that the
dead lampreys are dropped by the running water, and there
they sink into the soft ooze.</p>

<p>"The absence of great numbers of dead lampreys from
visible portions of the stream cannot be regarded as important
evidence against the argument that they die soon after spawning
once, as the bodies are very soon disintegrated in the water.
In the weir that we maintained in 1898, a number of old, worn-out,
and fungus-covered lampreys were caught drifting down-stream;
some were dead, some alive, and others dying and
already insensible, but none were seen going down that appeared
to be in condition to possibly regain their strength."</p>

THE CLASS ELASMOBRANCHII OR SHARK-LIKE
FISHES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_506.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Sharks.</b>&mdash;The gap between the lancelets and the
lampreys is a very wide one. Assuming the primitive
nature of both groups, this gap must represent the
period necessary for the evolution of brain, skull, and elaborate
sense organs. The interspace between the lampreys and the
nearest fish-like forms which follow them in an ascending scale
is not less remarkable. Between the lamprey and the shark
we have the development of paired fins with their basal attachments
of shoulder-girdle and pelvis, the formation of a lower
jaw, the relegation of the teeth to the borders of the mouth,
the development of separate vertebr&aelig; along the line of the
notochord, the development of the gill-arches, and of an external
covering of enameled points or placoid scales.</p>

<p>These traits of progress separate the Elasmobranchs from
all lower vertebrates. For those animals which possess them,
the class name of <i>Pisces</i> or fishes has been adopted by numerous
authors. If this term is to be retained for technical purposes,
it should be applied to the aquatic vertebrates above the lampreys
and lancelets. We may, however, regard fish as a popular
term only, rather than to restrict the name to members of a class
called <i>Pisces</i>. From the bony fishes, on the other hand, the
sharks are distinguished by the much less specialization of the
skeleton, both as regards form and substance, by the lack of
membrane bones, of air-bladder, and of true scales, and by
various peculiarities of the skeleton itself. The upper jaw, for
example, is formed not of maxillary and premaxillary, but of
elements which in the lower fishes would be regarded as belonging
to the palatine and pterygoid series. The lower jaw is formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
not of several pieces, but of a cartilage called Meckel's cartilage,
which in higher fishes precedes the development of a separate
dentary bone. These structures are sometimes called primary
jaws, as distinguished from secondary jaws or true jaws developed
in addition to those bones in the <i>Actinopteri</i> or typical
fishes. In the sharks the shoulder-girdle is attached, not to
the skull, but to a vertebra at some distance behind it, leaving
a distinct neck, such as is possessed or retained by the vertebrate
higher than fishes. The shoulder-girdle itself is a continuous
arch of cartilage, joining its fellow at the breast of the
fish. Other peculiar traits will be mentioned later.</p>

<p><b>Characters of Elasmobranchs.</b>&mdash;The essential character of the
Elasmobranchs as a whole are these: The skeleton is cartilaginous,
the skull without sutures, and the notochord more or
less fully replaced or inclosed by vertebral segments. The jaws
are peculiar in structure, as are also the teeth, which are usually
highly specialized and found on the jaws only. There are no
membrane bones; the shoulder-girdle is well developed, each
half of one piece of cartilage, and the ventral fins, with the
pelvic-girdle, are always present, always many-rayed, and
abdominal in position. The skin is covered with placoid scales,
or shagreen, or with bony bucklers, or else it is naked. It is
never provided with imbricated scales. The tail is diphycercal,
heterocercal, or else it degenerates into a whip-like organ, a
form which has been called leptocercal. The gill-arches are 5,
6, or 7 in number, with often an accessory gill-slit or spiracle.
The ventral fins in the males (except perhaps in certain primitive
forms) are provided with elaborate cartilaginous appendages
or claspers. The brain is elongate, its parts well separated,
the optic nerves interlacing. The heart has a contractile
arterial cone containing several rows of valves; the intestine
has a spiral valve; the eggs are large, hatched within the body,
or else deposited in a leathery case.</p>

<p><b>Classification of Elasmobranchs.</b>&mdash;The group of sharks and
their allies, rays, and Chim&aelig;ras, is usually known collectively as
<i>Elasmobranchii</i> (&#7952;&#955;&#8049;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;, blade or plate; &#946;&#961;&#8049;&#947;&#967;&#959;&#962;, gill). Other
names applied to all or a part of this group are these: <i>Selachii</i>
(&#963;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8057;&#962;, a cartilage, the name also used by the Greeks for the
gristle-fishes or sharks); <i>Plagiostomi</i> (&#960;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#953;&#8057;&#962;, oblique; &#963;&#964;&#8057;&#956;&#945;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
mouth); <i>Chondropterygii</i> (&#967;&#8057;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#962;, cartilage; &#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#8059;&#958;, fin); and
<i>Antacea</i> (&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;, sturgeon). They represent the most
primitive known type of jaw-bearing vertebrates, or <i>Gnathostomi</i>
(&#947;&#957;&#8049;&#952;&#959;&#962;, jaw; &#963;&#964;&#8057;&#956;&#945;, mouth), the Chordates without jaws
being sometimes called collectively <i>Agnatha</i> (&#7936;-&#947;&#957;&#8049;&#952;&#959;&#962;, without
jaws). These higher types of fishes have been also called
collectively <i>Lyrifera</i>, the form of the two shoulder-girdles taken
together being compared to that of a lyre. Through shark-like
forms all the higher vertebrates must probably trace their
descent. Sharks' teeth and fin-spines are found in all rocks
from the Upper Silurian deposits to the present time, and while
the majority of the genera are now extinct, the class has
had a vigorous representation in all the seas, later Pal&aelig;ozoic,
Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, as well as in recent times.</p>

<p>Most of the Elasmobranchs are large, coarse-fleshed, active
animals feeding on fishes, hunting down their prey through
superior strength and activity. But to this there are many
exceptions, and the highly specialized modern shark of the
type of the mackerel-shark or man-eater is by no means a fair
type of the whole great class, some of the earliest types being
diminutive, feeble, and toothless.</p>

<p><b>Subclasses of Elasmobranchs.</b>&mdash;With the very earliest recognizable
remains it is clear that the Elasmobranchs are already
divided into two great divisions, the sharks and the <i>Chim&aelig;ras</i>.
These groups we may call subclasses, the <i>Selachii</i> and the <i>Holocephali</i>,
or Chismopnea.</p>

<p>The <i>Selachii</i>, or sharks and rays, have the skull hyostylic,
that is, with the quadrate bone grown fast to the palate which
forms the upper jaw, the hyomandibular, acting as suspensorium
to the lower jaw, being articulated directly to it.</p>

<p>The palato-quadrate apparatus, the front of which forms
the upper jaw in the shark, is not fused to the cranium, although
it is sometimes articulated with it. There are as many external
gill-slits as there are gill-arches (5, 6, or 7), and the gills are
adnate to the flesh of their own arches, without free tips. The
cerebral hemispheres are grown together. The teeth are separated
and usually strongly specialized, being primitively modified
from the prickles or other defences of the skin. There is no
frontal holder or bony hook on the forehead of the male.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span></p>

<p>The subclass <i>Holocephali</i>, or <i>Chim&aelig;ras</i>, differ from the sharks
in all this series of characters, and its separation as a distinct
group goes back to the Devonian or even farther, the earliest
known sharks having little more in common with Chim&aelig;ras
than the modern forms have.</p>

<p><b>The Selachii.</b>&mdash;There have been many efforts to divide the
sharks and rays into natural orders. Most writers have contented
themselves with placing the sharks in one order (<i>Squali</i>
or <i>Galei</i> or <i>Pleurotremi</i>) having the gill-openings on the side,
and the rays in another (<i>Raj&aelig;</i>, <i>Batoidei</i>, <i>Hypotrema</i>) having
the gill-openings underneath. Of far more importance than
this superficial character of adaptation are the distinctions
drawn from the skeleton. Dr. Gill has used the attachment
of the palato-quadrate apparatus as the basis of a classification.
The <i>Opistharthri</i> (<i>Hexanchid&aelig;</i>) have this structure articulated
with the postorbital part of the skull. In the <i>Prosarthri</i> (<i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>)
it is articulated with the preorbital part of the skull,
while in the other sharks (<i>Anarthri</i>) it is not articulated at all.
But these characters do not appear to be always important.
<i>Chlamydoselachus</i>, for example, differs in this regard from
<i>Heptranchias</i>, which in other respects it closely resembles. Yet,
in general, the groups thus characterized are undoubtedly
natural ones.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Hasse's Classification of Elasmobranchs.</b>&mdash;In 1882, Professor
Carl Hasse proposed to subdivide the sharks on the basis of the
structure of the individual vertebr&aelig;. In the lowest group, a
hypothetical order of <i>Polyospondyli</i>, possibly represented by
the fossil spines called <i>Onchus</i>, an undivided notochord, perhaps
swollen at regular intervals, is assumed to have represented the
vertebral column. In the <i>Diplospondyli</i> (<i>Hexanchid&aelig;</i>) the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>perfectly
segmented vertebr&aelig; are joined in pairs, each pair
having two neural arches. In the <i>Asterospondyli</i> or ordinary
sharks each vertebra has its calcareous lamella radiating star-like
from the central axis. In the <i>Cyclospondyli</i> (<i>Squalid&aelig;</i>,
etc.) the calcareous part forms a single ring about the axis,
and in the <i>Tectospondyli</i> (<i>Squatina</i>, rays, etc.) it forms several
rings. These groups again are natural and correspond fairly
with those based on other characters. At the same time
there is no far-reaching difference between <i>Cyclospondyli</i> and
<i>Tectospondyli</i>, and the last-named section includes both sharks
and rays.</p>

(<i>Carcharias</i>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Nothing is known of the <i>Polyospondyli</i>, and they may never
have existed at all. The <i>Diplospondyli</i> do not differ very
widely from the earlier <i>Asterospondyli</i> (<i>Cestraciontes</i>) which, as a
matter of fact, have preceded the <i>Diplospondyli</i> in point of
time, if we can trust our present knowledge of the geological
record.</p>

<p><b>Other Classifications of Elasmobranchs.</b>&mdash;Characters more fundamental
may be drawn from the structure of the pectoral
fin. In this regard four distinct types appear. In <i>Acanthoessus</i>
this fin consists of a stout, stiff spine, with a rayless membrane
attached behind it. In <i>Cladoselache</i> the fin is low, with a very
long base, like a fold of skin (<i>ptychopterygium</i>), and composed
of feeble rays. In <i>Pleuracanthus</i> it is a jointed axis of many
segments, with a fringe of slender fin-rays, corresponding in
structure to all appearance to the pectoral fin of Dipnoans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
Crossopterygians, the type called by Gegenbaur <i>archipterygium</i>
on the hypothesis that it represents the primitive vertebrate
limb.</p>

<p>In most sharks the fin has a fan-shape, with three of the
basal segments larger than the others. Of these the mesopterygium
is the central one, with the propterygium before it
and the metapterygium behind. In the living sharks of the
family of <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>, this form of fin occurs and the teeth
of the same general type constitute the earliest remains distinctly
referable to sharks in the Devonian rocks.</p>

<p><b>Primitive Sharks.</b>&mdash;Admitting that these four types of pectoral
fin should constitute separate orders, we have next to
consider which form is the most primitive and what is the
line of descent. In this matter we have, in the phrase of H&aelig;ckel,
only the "three ancestral documents, Pal&aelig;ontology, Morphology,
and Ontogeny."</p>

<p>Unfortunately the evidence of these documents is incomplete
and conflicting. So far as Pal&aelig;ontology is concerned,
the fin of <i>Cladoselache</i>, with that of <i>Acanthoessus</i>, which may
be derived from it, appears earliest, but the modern type
of pectoral fin with the three basal segments is assumed to
have accompanied the teeth of Psammodonts and Cochliodonts,
while the fin of the Chim&aelig;ra must have been developed
in the Devonian. The jointed fin of <i>Cladodus</i> and <i>Pleuracanthus</i>
may be a modification or degradation of the ordinary
type of shark-fin.</p>

<p>Assuming, however, that the geological record is not perfect
and that the fin of <i>Cladoselache</i> is not clearly shown to be primitive,
we have next to consider the evidence drawn from morphology.</p>

<p>Those who with Balfour and others (see page <a href="#Page_69">69</a>) accept the
theory that the paired fins are derived from a vertebral fold,
will regard with Dean the fin of <i>Cladoselache</i> as coming nearest
the theoretical primitive condition.</p>

<p>The pectoral fin in <i>Acanthoessus</i> Dean regards as a specialized
derivative from a fin like that of <i>Cladoselache</i>, the fin-rays
being gathered together at the front and joined together to
form the thick spine characteristic of <i>Acanthoessus</i>. This view
of the morphology of the fin of <i>Acanthoessus</i> is not accepted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
Woodward, and several different suggestions have been recorded.</p>

<p>If with Gegenbaur we regard the paired fins as derived
from the septa between the gill-slits, or with Kerr regard them
as modified external gills, the whole theoretical relation of
the parts is changed. The archipterygium of <i>Pleuracanthus</i>
would be the nearest approach to the primitive pectoral limb,
and from this group and its allies all the other sharks are
descended. This central jointed axis of <i>Pleuracanthus</i> is regarded
by Traquair as the equivalent of the metapterygium
in ordinary sharks. (See Figs. 44, 45, 46.)</p>

<p>According to Traquair: "The median stern [of the archipterygium],
simplified, shortened up and losing all its radials
on the postaxial side, except in sometimes a few near the tip,
becomes the metapterygium, while the mesopterygium and
propterygium are formed by the fusion into two pieces of the
basal joints of a number of preaxial radials, which have reached
and become attached to the shoulder-girdle in front of the
metapterygium."</p>

<p>According to Dr. Traquair, the pectoral fin in <i>Cladodus
neilsoni</i>, a shark from the Coal Measures of Scotland, is "apparently
a veritable uniserial archipterygium midway between the
truly biserial one of <i>Pleuracanthus</i> and the pectoral fin of ordinary
sharks." Other authors look on these matters differently,
and Dr. Traquair admits that an opposite view is almost equally
probable. Cope and Dean would derive the tribasal pectoral
of ordinary sharks directly from the ptychopterygium or fan-like
fold of <i>Cladoselache</i>, while Fritsch and Woodward would look
upon it as derived in turn from the <i>Ceratodus</i>-like fin of <i>Pleuracanthus</i>,
itself derived from the ptychopterygium or remains
of a lateral fin-fold.</p>

<p>If the Dipnoans are descended from the Crossopterygians, as
Dollo has tried to show, the archipterygium of <i>Pleuracanthus</i>
has had a different origin from the similar-appearing limb of
the Dipnoans, <i>Dipterus</i> and <i>Ceratodus</i>.</p>

<p>In such case the archipterygium would not be the primitive
pectoral limb, but a structure which may have been independently
evolved in two different groups.</p>

<p>In the view of Gegenbaur, the Crossopterygians and Dipnoans
with all the higher vertebrates and the bony fishes would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
arise from the same primitive stock, ancestors, or allies of the
<i>Ichthyotomi</i>, which group would also furnish the ancestors
of the <i>Chim&aelig;ras</i>. In support of this view, the primitive protocercal
or diphycercal tail of <i>Pleuracanthus</i> may be brought
in evidence as against the apparently more specialized heterocercal
tail of <i>Cladoselache</i>. But this is not conclusive, as the
diphycercal tail may arise separately in different groups through
degeneration, as Dollo and Boulenger have shown.</p>

<p>The matter is one mainly of morphological interpretation,
and no final answer can be given. On page <a href="#Page_68">68</a> a summary of
the various arguments may be found. Little light is given
by embryology. The evidence of Pal&aelig;ontology, so far as it
goes, certainly favors the view of Balfour. Omitting detached
fin-spines and fragments of uncertain character, the earliest
identifiable remains of sharks belong to the lower Devonian.
These are allies of <i>Acanthoessus</i>. <i>Cladoselache</i> comes next in
the Upper Devonian. <i>Pleuracanthus</i> appears with the teeth
and spines supposed to belong to Cestraciont sharks, in the
Carboniferous Age. The primitive-looking <i>Notidani</i> do not
appear before the Triassic. For this reason the decision as
to which is the most primitive type of shark must therefore
rest unsettled for the present and perhaps for a long time
to come.</p>

<p>The weight of authority at present seems to favor the view
of Balfour, Wiedersheim, Boulenger, and Dean, that the pectoral
limb has arisen from a lateral fold of skin. But weight
of authority is not sufficient when evidence is confessedly
lacking.</p>

<p>For our purpose, without taking sides in this controversy, we
may follow Dean in allowing <i>Cladoselache</i> to stand as the most
primitive of known sharks, thus arranging the Elasmobranchs
and rays, recent and fossil, in six orders of unequal value&mdash;<i>Pleuropterygii</i>,
<i>Acanthodei</i>, <i>Ichthyotomi</i>, <i>Notidani</i>, <i>Asterospondyli</i>,
and <i>Tectospondyli</i>. Of these orders the first and second are
closely related, as are also the fourth and fifth, the sixth being
not far remote. The true sharks form the culmination of one
series, the rays of another, while from the <i>Ichthyotomi</i> the Crossopterygians
and their descendants may be descended. But
this again is very hypothetical, or perhaps impossible; while, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
the other hand, the relation of the Chim&aelig;ras to the sharks is
still far from clearly understood.</p>

<p><b>Order Pleuropterygii.</b>&mdash;The order of <i>Pleuropterygii</i> of Dean
(&#960;&#955;&#949;&#8059;&#961;&#959;&#957;, side; &#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#8059;&#958;, fin), called by Parker and Haswell <i>Cladoselachea</i>,
consists of sharks in which the pectoral and ventral
fins have each a very wide horizontal base (ptychopterygium),
without jointed axis and without spine. There are no spines
in any of the fins. The dorsal fin is low, and there were probably
two of them. The notochord is persistent, without intercalary
cartilage, such as appear in the higher sharks. The
caudal fin is short, broad, and strongly heterocercal. Apparently
the ventral fin is without claspers. The gill-openings were
probably covered by a dermal fold. The teeth are weak,
being modified denticles from the asperities of the skin. The
lateral line is represented by an open groove. The family of
<i>Cladoselachid&aelig;</i> consists of a single genus <i>Cladoselache</i> from the
Cleveland shale or Middle Devonian of Ohio. <i>Cladoselache fyleri</i>
is the best-known species, reaching a length of about two feet.
Dean regards this as the most primitive of the sharks, and the
position of the pectorals and ventrals certainly lend weight
to Balfour's theory that they were originally derived from a
lateral fold of skin. I am recently informed by Dr. Dean that
he has considerable evidence that in <i>Cladoselache</i> the anus
was <i>subterminal</i>. If this statement is verified, it would go far
to establish the primitive character of <i>Cladoselache</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Order Acanthodei.</b>&mdash;Near the <i>Pleuropterygii</i>, although much
more highly developed, we may note the strange group of <i>Acanthodei</i>
(&#7936;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#8061;&#948;&#951;&#962;, spinous). These armed fishes were once placed
among the Crossopterygians, but there seems no doubt that
Woodward is right in regarding them as a highly specialized aberrant
offshoot of the primitive sharks. In this group the paired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
fins consist each of a single stout spine, nearly or quite destitute
of other rays. A similar spine is placed in front of the dorsal
fin and one in front of the anal. According to Dean these
spines are each produced by the growing together of all the
fin-rays normally belonging to the fin, a view of their morphology
not universally accepted.</p>

</div>

<p>The dermal covering is highly specialized, the shagreen denticles
being much enlarged and thickened, often set in little
squares suggesting a checker-board. The skull is covered
with small bony plates and membrane bones form a sort of
ring about the eye. The teeth are few, large, and "degenerate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
in their fibrous structure." Some of the species have certainly
no teeth at all. The tail is always heterocercal, or bent upward
at tip as in the <i>Cladoselache</i>, not diphycercal, tapering and
horizontal as in the <i>Ichthyotomi</i>.</p>

<p>The lower Acanthodeans, according to Woodward, "are the
only vertebrates in which there are any structures in the adult
apart from the two pairs of fins which may be plausibly interpreted
as remnants of once continuous lateral folds. In
<i>Climatius</i>, one of the most primitive genera (see Fig. 305), there
exists, according to Woodward, and as first noticed by Cope,
between the pectoral and pelvic (or ventral) fins a close and
regular series of paired spines, in every respect identical with
those supporting the appendages that presumably correspond
to the two pairs of fins in the higher genera. They may even
have supported fin membranes, though specimens sufficiently
well preserved to determine this point have not yet been discovered.
However, it is evident that dermal calcifications
attained a greater development in the <i>Acanthodei</i> than in any of
the more typical Elasmobranchs, and we may look for much
additional information on the subject when the great fishes
to which the undetermined <i>Ichthyodorulites</i> pertained became
known." (See Fig. 305.)</p>

<p>The <i>Acanthodei</i> constitute three families. In the <i>Acanthoessid&aelig;</i>
there is but one short dorsal fin opposite the anal,
and clavicular bones are absent. The gill-openings being provided
with "frills" or collar-like margins, perhaps resembled
those of the living genus <i>Chlamydoselachus</i>, the frilled shark. The
pectoral spine is very strong, and about the eye is a ring of
four plates. The body is elongate, tapering, and compressed.
<i>Acanthoessus</i> of Agassiz, the name later changed by its author to
<i>Acanthodes</i>, is the principal genus, found in the Devonian and
Carboniferous.</p>

<p>The species of <i>Acanthoessus</i> are all small fishes rarely more
than a foot long, with very small teeth or none, and with the
skin well armed with a coat-of-mail. <i>Acanthoessus bronni</i> is
the one longest known. In the earliest species known, from
the Devonian, the ventral fins are almost as large as the pectorals
and nearly midway between pectorals and anal. In
the later species the pectoral fins become gradually larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
and the ventrals move forward. In the Permian species the
pectorals are enormous.</p>

<p><i>Traquairia pygm&aelig;a</i>, from the Permian of Bohemia, is a diminutive
sharklet three or four inches long with large scales,
slender spines, and apparently no ventral fins.</p>

<p>In the genus <i>Cheiracanthus</i> the dorsal fin is placed before the
anal. In <i>Acanthodopsis</i> the teeth are few, large, and triangular,
and the fin-spines relatively large.</p>

<p>The <i>Ischnacanthid&aelig;</i> have no clavicles, and two dorsal fins.
<i>Ischnacanthus gracilis</i> of the Devonian has a few large conical
teeth with small cusps between them.</p>

<p>The <i>Diplacanthid&aelig;</i>, with two dorsal fins, possess bones
interpreted as clavicles. The teeth are minute or absent. In
<i>Diplacanthus striatus</i> and <i>Diplacanthus longispinus</i> of the Lower
Devonian stout spines are attached to the shoulder-girdle
between the pectoral spines below.</p>

(After Nicholson). (Restoration of jaws and gill-openings; after Traquair.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the very small sharks called <i>Climatius</i> the fin-spines are
very strong, and a series of several free spines occurs, as above
stated, on each side between the pectoral and ventral fins, a
supposed trace of a former lateral fold. In <i>Paraxus</i> the first
dorsal spine is enormously enlarged in size, the other spines
remaining much as in <i>Climatius</i>.</p>

<p><b>Dean on Acanthodei.</b>&mdash;In his latest treatise on these fishes,
"The Devonian Lamprey," Dr. Dean unites the <i>Pleuropterygii</i>
and <i>Acanthodei</i> in a single order under the former name, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>garding
<i>Acanthoessus</i> as an ally and perhaps descendant of
the primitive <i>Cladoselache</i>. Dr. Dean observes:</p>

<p>"In the foregoing classification it will be noted that the
Acanthodia are regarded as included under the first order
of sharks, <i>Pleuropterygii</i>. To this arrangement Smith Woodward
has already objected that the spines of Acanthodians
cannot be regarded as the homologues of the radial elements
of the Cladoselachian fin (which by a process of concrescence
have become fused in its interior margin), since he believes
the structure to be entirely dermal in origin. His criticism,
however, does not seem to me to be well grounded, for, although
all will admit that Acanthodian spines have become incrusted,
and deeply incrusted, with a purely dermal calcification, it
does not follow that the interior of the spine has not had primitively
a non-dermal core. That the concrescence of the radial
supporting elements of the fin took place <i>pari passu</i> with the
development of a strengthening dermal support of the fin
margin was the view expressly formulated in my previous
paper on this subject. It is of interest in this connection to
recall that the earliest types of Acanthodian spines were the
widest, and those which, in spite of their incasing dermal calcification,
suggest most clearly the parallel elements representing
the component radial supports. There should also be
recalled the many features in which the Acanthodians have
been shown to resemble <i>Cladoselache</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>From these primitive extinct types of shark we may proceed
to those forms which have representatives among living
fishes. From <i>Cladoselache</i> a fairly direct series extends through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
the <i>Notidani</i> and <i>Cestraciontes</i>, culminating in the Lamnoid
and Galeoid sharks.</p>

<p>Still another series, destitute of anal fin, probably arising
near the <i>Acanthodei</i>, reaches its highest development in the
side branch of the <i>Batoidei</i> or rays. The <i>Holocephali</i> and
<i>Dipneusti</i> must also find their origin in some of these primitive
types, certainly not in any form of more highly specialized
sharks.</p>

<p>Woodward prefers to place the <i>Tectospondyli</i> next to the
<i>Ichthyotomi</i>, leaving the specialized sharks to be treated later.
There is, however, no linear system which can interpret natural
affinities, and we follow custom in placing the dogfishes and
rays at the end of the shark series.</p>

<p><b>Order Ichthyotomi.</b>&mdash;In the order <i>Ichthyotomi</i> (&#7984;&#967;&#952;&#8059;&#962;, fish;
&#964;&#959;&#956;&#8057;&#962;, cutting; named by Cope from the supposed segmentation
of the cranium; called by Parker and Haswell <i>Pleuracanthea</i>)
the very large pectoral fins are developed each as an archipterygium.
Each fin consists of a long segmented axis fringed
on one or both sides with fin-rays.
The notochord is very
simple, scarcely or never constricted,
the calcifications of its
sheath "arrested at the most
primitive or rhachitomous stage,
except in the tail." This is
the best defined of the orders of
sharks, and should perhaps rank rather as a subclass, as the
<i>Holocephali</i>. Two families of <i>Ichthyotomi</i> are recognized by
Woodward, the <i>Pleuracanthid&aelig;</i> and the <i>Cladodontid&aelig;</i>. In the
<i>Pleuracanthid&aelig;</i> the dorsal fin is long and low, continuous from
head to tail, and the pectoral rays are in two rows. There
is a long barbed spine with two rows of serrations at the nape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
The body is slender, not depressed, and probably covered with
smooth skin. The teeth have two or more blunt cusps, sometimes
with a smaller one between and a blunt button behind.
The interneural cartilages are more numerous than the neural
spines. The genera are imperfectly known, the skeleton of
<i>Pleuracanthus decheni</i> only being well preserved. This is the
type of the genus called <i>Xenacanthus</i> which, according to Woodward,
is identical with <i>Pleuracanthus</i>, a genus otherwise known
from spines only. The denticles on the spine are straight
or hooked backward, in <i>Pleuracanthus</i> (<i>l&aelig;vissimus</i>), the spine
being flattened. In <i>Orthacanthus</i> (<i>cylindricus</i>), the spine is
cylindrical in section. The species called <i>Dittodus</i> and <i>Didymodus</i>
are known from the teeth only. These resemble the
teeth of <i>Chlamydoselachus</i>. It is not known that <i>Dittodus</i> possesses
the nuchal spine, although detached spines like those of
<i>Pleuracanthus</i> lie about in remains called <i>Didymodus</i> in the
Permian rocks of Texas. In <i>Dicranodus texensis</i> the palato-quadrate
articulates with the postorbital process of the cranium,
as in the <i>Hexanchid&aelig;</i>, and the hyomandibular is slender.</p>

Scotland, is supposed to belong to the <i>Pleuracanthid&aelig;</i>, from
the resemblance of the skeleton. It has no nuchal spine, and
no trace of paired fins is preserved.</p>

<p>The <i>Cladodontid&aelig;</i> differ in having the "pectoral fin developed
in the form of a uniserial
archipterygium intermediate between
the truly biserial one of <i>Pleuracanthus</i>
and the pectoral fin of modern sharks."
The numerous species are known
mainly from detached teeth, especially
abundant in America, the earliest
being in the Lower Carboniferous. One
species, <i>Cladodus nelsoni</i> (Fig. 310),
described by Traquair, from the sub-Carboniferous of Scotland
shows fairly the structure of the pectoral fin.</p>

the <i>Cladoselachid&aelig;</i> and <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>, both of which groups
long preceded it in geological time.</p>

<p>The name <i>Notidani</i> (<i>Notidanus</i>, &#957;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#948;&#8049;&#957;&#959;&#962;, dry back, an old
name of one of the genera) may be retained for this group,
which corresponds to the <i>Diplospondyli</i> of Hasse, the <i>Opistharthri</i>
of Gill, and the <i>Protoselachii</i> of Parker and Haswell.
The <i>Notidani</i> are characterized by the primitive structure of
the spinal column, which is without calcareous matter, the centra
being imperfectly developed. There are six or seven branchial
arches, and in the typical forms (not in <i>Chlamydoselachus</i>) the
palato-quadrate or upper jaw articulates with the postorbital
region of the skull. The teeth are of primitive character, of
different forms in the same jaw, each with many cusps. The
fins are without spines, the pectoral fin having the three basal
cartilages (mesopterygium with propterygium and metapterygium)
as usual among sharks.</p>

<p>The few living forms are of high interest. The extinct species
are numerous, but not very different from the living species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Family Hexanchid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The majority of the living Notidanoid
sharks belong to the family of <i>Hexanchid&aelig;</i>. These sharks have
six or seven gill-openings, one dorsal fin, and a relatively simple
organization. The bodies are moderately elongate, not eel-shaped,
and the palato-quadrate articulates with the postorbital
part of the skull. The six or eight species are found
sparsely in the warm seas. The two genera, <i>Hexanchus</i>, with
six, and <i>Heptranchias</i>, with seven vertebr&aelig;, are found in the
Mediterranean. The European species are <i>Hexanchus griseus</i>,
the cow-shark, and <i>Heptranchias cinereus</i>. The former crosses
to the West Indies. In California, <i>Heptranchias maculatus</i>
and <i>Hexanchus corinus</i> are occasionally taken, while <i>Heptranchias
deani</i> is the well known Aburazame or oil shark of Japan.
<i>Heptranchias indicus</i>, a similar species, is found in India.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 313.</span>&mdash;Teeth of <i>Heptranchias indicus</i> Gmelin.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fossil <i>Hexanchid&aelig;</i> exist in large numbers, all of them referred
by Woodward to the genus <i>Notidanus</i> (which is a later
name than <i>Hexanchus</i> and <i>Heptranchias</i> and intended to include
both these genera), differing chiefly in the number of gill-openings,
a character not ascertainable in the fossils. None
of these, however, appear before Cretaceous time, a fact which
may indicate that the simplicity of structure in <i>Hexanchus</i> and
<i>Heptranchias</i> is a result of degeneration and not altogether a
mark of primitive simplicity. The group is apparently much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
younger than the Cestraciontes and little older than the Lamnoids,
or the Squaloid groups. <i>Heptranchias microdon</i> is common
in English Cretaceous rocks, and <i>Heptranchias primigenius</i>
and other species are found in the Eocene.</p>

<p><b>Family Chlamydoselachid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;Very great interest is attached to
the recent discovery by Samuel Garman of the frilled shark,
<i>Chlamydoselachus anguineus</i>, the sole living representative of
the <i>Chlamydoselachid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

Japan. (After G&uuml;nther.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>This shark was first found on the coast of Japan, where it
is rather common in deep water. It has since been taken off
Madeira and off the coast of Norway. It is a long, slender,
eel-shaped shark with six gill-openings and the palato-quadrate
not articulated to the cranium. The notochord is mainly
persistent, in part replaced by feeble cyclospondylic vertebral
centra. Each gill-opening is bordered by a broad frill of skin.
There is but one dorsal fin. The teeth closely resemble those
of <i>Dittodus</i> or <i>Didymodus</i> and other extinct <i>Ichthyotomi</i>. The
teeth have broad, backwardly extended bases overlapping,
the crown consisting of three slender curved cusps, separated
by rudimentary denticles. Teeth of a fossil species, <i>Chlamydoselachus
lawleyi</i>, are recorded by J. W. Davis from the Pliocene
of Tuscany.</p>

<p><b>Order Asterospondyli.</b>&mdash;The order of <i>Asterospondyli</i> comprises
the typical sharks, those in which the individual vertebr&aelig; are
well developed, the calcareous lamell&aelig; arranged so as to radiate,
star-fashion, from the central axis. All these sharks possess
two dorsal fins and one anal fin, the pectoral fin is normally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
developed, with the three basal cartilages; there are five gill-openings,
and the tail is heterocercal.</p>

<i>Prosarthri</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Family Heterodontid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;Among recent species this group
contains only the family of <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>, the bullhead sharks,
or Port Jackson sharks. In this family the head is high, with
usually projecting eyebrows, the lateral teeth are pad-like,
ridged or rounded, arranged in many rows, different from the
pointed anterior teeth, the fins are large, the coloration is strongly
marked, and the large egg-cases are spirally twisted. All
have five gill-openings. The living species of <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>
are found only in the Pacific, the Port Jackson shark of Australia,
<i>Heterodontus philippi</i>, being longest known. Other species
are <i>Heterodontus francisci</i>, common in California, <i>Heterodontus
japonicus</i>, in Japan, and <i>Heterodontus zebra</i>, in China. These
small and harmless sharks at once attract attention by their
peculiar forms. In the American species the jaws are less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
contracted than in the Asiatic species, called <i>Heterodontus</i>.
For this reason Dr. Gill has separated the former under the
name of <i>Gyropleurodus</i>. The differences are, however, of slight
value. The genus <i>Heterodontus</i> first appears in the Jurassic,
where a number of species are known, one of the earliest
being <i>Heterodontus falcifer</i>.</p>

<p>Three families of <i>Cestraciontes</i> are recognized by Hay. The
most primitive of these is the group of <i>Orodontid&aelig;</i>. <i>Orodus</i>,
from the Lower Carboniferous, has the
teeth with a central crown, its surface
wrinkled. Of the <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>, <i>Hybodus</i>,
of the Carboniferous and Triassic,
is one of the earliest and largest genera,
characterized by elongate teeth of many
cusps, different in different parts of the
jaw, somewhat as in the <i>Hexanchid&aelig;</i>,
the median points being, however,
always longest. The dorsal fins are provided with long spines
serrated behind. The vertebr&aelig; with persistent notochord show
qualities intermediate between those of <i>Hexanchid&aelig;</i> and <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>,
and the same relation is shown by the teeth. In this
genus two large hooked half-barbed dermal spines occur behind
each orbit.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Pal&aelig;ospinax</i>, with short stout spines and very large pectoral
fins, formerly regarded as a dogfish, is placed near <i>Heterodontus</i>
by Woodward. <i>Acrodus</i>, from the Triassic, shows considerable
resemblance to <i>Heterodontus</i>. Its teeth are rounded and without
cusps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of these species belong to the Carboniferous, Triassic,
and Jurassic, although some fragments ascribed to Cestraciont
sharks occur in the Upper Silurian. <i>Asteracanthus</i>,
known only from fin-spines in the
Jura, probably belongs here.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact first noted by Dr.
Hay, that with all the great variety of sharks,
ten families in the Carboniferous age, representatives
of but one family, <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>,
are found in the Triassic. This family may
be the parent of all subsequent sharks and
rays, six families of these appearing in the
Jurassic and many more in the Cretaceous.</p>

<p><b>Edestus and its Allies.</b>&mdash;Certain monstrous
structures, hitherto thought to be fin-spines,
are now shown by Dr. Eastman and others to be coalescent teeth
of Cestraciont sharks.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 339px;">

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 324.&mdash;<i>Edestus vorax</i> Leidig, supposed to be a whorl of teeth.
(After Newberry.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>These remarkable <i>Ichthyodorulites</i> are characteristic structures
of sharks of unknown nature, but probably related to the
<i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>. Of these the principal genera are <i>Edestus</i>,
<i>Helicoprion</i>, and <i>Campyloprion</i>. Karpinsky regards these
ornate serrated spiral structures as whorls of unshed teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
cemented together and extending outside the mouth, "sharp,
piercing teeth which were never shed but became fused in
whorls as the animals grew."</p>

<p>Dr. Eastman has, however, shown that these supposed
teeth of <i>Edestus</i> are much like those of the <i>Cochliodontid&aelig;</i>, and
the animals which bore them should doubtless find their place
among the Cestraciont sharks, perhaps within the family of
<i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Onchus.</b>&mdash;The name <i>Onchus</i> was applied by Agassiz to small
laterally compressed spines, their sides ornamented with smooth
or faintly crenulated longitudinal ridges, and with no denticles
behind. Very likely these belonged to extinct Cestraciont
sharks. <i>Onchus murchisoni</i> and <i>Onchus tenuistriatus</i> occur in
the Upper Silurian rocks of England, in the lowest strata in
which sharks have been found.</p>

<p>To a hypothetical group of primitive sharks Dr. Hasse
has given the name of <i>Polyospondyli</i>. In these supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
ancestral sharks the vertebr&aelig; were without any ossification, a
simple notochord, possibly swollen at intervals. The dorsal
fin was single and long, a fold of skin with perhaps a single
spine as an anterior support. The teeth must have been
modified dermal papill&aelig;, each probably with many cusps.
Probably seven gill-openings were developed, and the tail
was diphycercal, ending in a straight point. The finely
striated fin-spines not curved upward at tip, called <i>Onchus</i> from
the Upper Silurian of the Ludlow shales of England and elsewhere,
are placed by Hasse near his Polyspondylous sharks.
Such spines have been retained by the group of <i>Chim&aelig;ras</i>,
supposed to be derived from the ancestors of <i>Onchus</i>, as well
as by the <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i> and <i>Squalid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p><b>Family Cochliodontid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;Another ancient family known from
teeth alone is that of <i>Cochliodontid&aelig;</i>. These teeth resemble
those of the <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>, but are more highly specialized.
The form of the body is unknown,
and the animals may
have been rays rather than
sharks. Eastman leaves
them near the <i>Petalodontid&aelig;</i>,
which group of supposed
rays shows a similar dentition.
The teeth are convex
in form, strongly arched,
hollowed at base, and often
marked by ridges or folds,
being without sharp cusps. In each jaw is a strong posterior tooth
with smaller teeth about. The elaborate specialization of these
ancient teeth for crushing or grinding shells is very remarkable.
The species are chiefly confined to rocks of the Carboniferous
age. Among the principal genera are <i>Helodus</i>,
<i>Psephodus</i>, <i>Sandalodus</i>, <i>Venustodus</i>, <i>Xystrodus</i>, <i>Deltodus</i>, <i>P&oelig;cilodus</i>,
and <i>Cochliodus</i>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 326.</span>&mdash;Lower jaw of <i>Cochliodus contortus</i>
Agassiz. Carboniferous. (After Zittel.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Concerning the teeth of various fossil sharks, Dr. Dean
observes: "Their general character appears to have been primitive,
but in structural details they were certainly specialized.
Thus their dentition had become adapted to a shellfish diet,
and they had evolved defensive spines at the fin margins, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>times
at the sides of the head. In some cases the teeth remain
as primitive shagreen cusps on the rim of the mouth, but become
heavy and bluntish behind; in other forms the fusion
of tooth clusters may present the widest range in their adaptations
for crushing; and the curves and twistings of the tritoral
surfaces may have resulted in the most specialized forms
of dentition which are known to occur, not merely in sharks
but among all vertebrates."</p>

<p>In this neighborhood belongs, perhaps, the family of <i>Tamiobatid&aelig;</i>,
known from the skull of a single specimen, called <i>Tamiobatis
vetustus</i>, from the Devonian in eastern Kentucky. The
head has the depressed form of a ray, but it is probably a shark
and one of the very earliest known.</p>

<p><b>Suborder Galei.</b>&mdash;The great body of recent sharks belong to
the suborder <i>Galei</i>, or <i>Euselachii</i>, characterized by the asterospondylous
vertebr&aelig;, each having a star-shaped nucleus, and
by the fact that the palato-quadrate apparatus or upper jaw
is not articulated with the skull. The sharks of this suborder
are the most highly specialized of the group, the strongest and
largest and, in general, the most active and voracious. They
are of three types and naturally group themselves about the
three central families <i>Scyliorhinid&aelig;</i>, <i>Lamnid&aelig;</i>, and <i>Carchariid&aelig;</i>
(<i>Galeorhinid&aelig;</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>Asterospondyli</i> are less ancient than the preceding groups,
but the modern families were well differentiated in Mesozoic
times.</p>

<p>Among the <i>Galei</i> the dentition is less complex than with
the ancient forms, although the individual teeth are more
highly specialized. The teeth are usually adapted for biting,
often with knife-like or serrated edges; only the outer teeth
are in function; as they are gradually lost, the inner teeth are
moved outward, gradually taking the place of these.</p>

<p>We may place first, as most primitive, the forms without
nictitating membrane.</p>

<p><b>Family Scyliorhinid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The most primitive of the modern
families is doubtless that of the <i>Scyliorhinid&aelig;</i>, or cat-sharks.
This group includes sharks with the dorsal fins both behind
the ventrals, the tail not keeled and not bent upward, the
spiracles present, and the teeth small and close-set. The species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
are small and mostly spotted, found in the warm seas. All
of them lay their eggs in large cases, oblong, and with long
filaments or strings at the corners. The cat-sharks, or roussettes,
<i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i> and <i>Catulus stellaris</i>, abound in
the Mediterranean. Their skin is used as shagreen or sandpaper
in polishing furniture. The species of swell-sharks
(<i>Cephaloscylium</i>) (<i>C. uter</i>, in California; <i>C. ventriosus</i>, in Chile;
<i>C. laticeps</i>, in Australia; <i>C. umbratile</i>, in Japan) are short,
wide-bodied sharks, which have the habit of filling the capacious
stomach with air, then floating belly upward like a globefish.
Other species are found in the depths of the sea. <i>Scyliorhinus</i>,
<i>Catulus</i>, and numerous other genera are found fossil.
The earliest is <i>Pal&aelig;oscyllium</i>, in the Jurassic, not very different
from <i>Scyliorhinus</i>, but the fins are described as more
nearly like those of <i>Ginglymostoma</i>.</p>

<p>Close to the <i>Scyliorhinid&aelig;</i> is the Asiatic family, <i>Hemiscylliid&aelig;</i>,
which differs in being ovoviviparous, the young,
according to Mr. Edgar R. Waite, hatched within the body.
The general appearance is that of the <i>Scyliorhinid&aelig;</i>, the body
being elongate. <i>Chiloscyllium</i> is a well-known genus with several
species in the East Indies. <i>Chiloscyllium modestum</i> is the
dogfish of the Australian fishermen. The <i>Orectolobid&aelig;</i> are thick-set
sharks, with large heads provided with fleshy fringes. <i>Orectolobus
barbatus</i> (<i>Crossorhinus</i> of authors) abounds from Japan
to Australia.</p>

<p>Another family, <i>Ginglymostomid&aelig;</i>, differs mainly in the
form of the tail, which is long and bent abruptly upward at
its base. These large sharks, known as nurse-sharks, are found
in the warm seas. <i>Ginglymostoma cirrhatum</i> is the common
species with <i>Orectolobus</i>. <i>Stegostoma tigrinum</i>, of the Indian
seas and north to Japan, one of several genera called tiger-sharks,
is remarkable for its handsome spotted coloration.
The extinct genus <i>Pseudogaleus</i> (<i>voltai</i>) is said to connect the
<i>Scyliorhinoid</i> with the <i>Carcharioid</i> sharks.</p>

<p><b>The Lamnoid or Mackerel Sharks.</b>&mdash;The most active and most
ferocious of the sharks, as well as the largest and some of the
most sluggish, belong to a group of families known collectively
as Lamnoid, because of a general resemblance to the mackerel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>-shark,
or <i>Lamna</i>, as distinguished from the blue sharks and
white sharks allied to <i>Carcharias</i> (<i>Carcharhinus</i>).</p>

<p>The Lamnoid sharks agree with the cat-sharks in the absence
of nictitating membrane or third eyelid, but differ in the anterior
insertion of the first dorsal fin, which is before the ventrals.
Some of these sharks have the most highly specialized
teeth to be found among fishes, most effective as knives or as
scissors. Still others have the most highly specialized tails,
either long and flail-like, or short, broad, and muscular, fitting
the animal for swifter progression than is possible for any other
sharks. The Lamnoid families are especially numerous as
fossils, their teeth abounding in all suitable rock deposits from
Mesozoic times till now. Among the Lamnoid sharks numerous
families must be recognized.</p>

<p>The most primitive is perhaps that of the <i>Odontaspidid&aelig;</i>
(called <i>Carchariid&aelig;</i> by some recent authors), now chiefly extinct,
with the tail unequal and not keeled, and the teeth slender
and sharp, often with smaller cusps at their base. <i>Odontaspis</i>
and its relatives of the same genus are numerous, from the
Cretaceous onward, and three species are still extant, small
sharks of a voracious habit, living on sandy shores. <i>Odontaspis
littoralis</i> (also known as <i>Carcharias littoralis</i>) is the common
sand-shark of our Atlantic coast. <i>Odontaspis taurus</i> is
a similar form in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><b>Family Mitsukurinid&aelig;, the Goblin-sharks.</b>&mdash;Closely allied to
<i>Odontaspis</i> is the small family of <i>Mitsukurinid&aelig;</i>, of which a single
living species is known. The teeth are like those of <i>Odontaspis</i>,
but the appearance is very different.</p>

<p>The goblin-shark, or Tenguzame, <i>Mitsukurina owstoni</i>, is a
very large shark rarely taken in the Kuro Shiwo, or warm "Black
Current" of Japan. It is characterized by the development
of the snout into a long flat blade, extending far beyond the
mouth, much as in <i>Polyodon</i> and in certain Chim&aelig;ras. Several
specimens are now known, all taken by Capt. Alan Owston
of Yokohama in Sagami Bay, Japan. The original specimen,
a young shark just born, was presented by him to Professor
Kakichi Mitsukuri of the University of Tokyo. From this
our figure was taken. The largest specimen now known is in
the United States National Museum and is fourteen feet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
length. In the Upper Cretaceous is a very similar genus,
<i>Scapanorhynchus</i> (<i>lewisi</i>, etc.), which Professor Woodward thinks
may be even generically identical with <i>Mitsukurina</i>, though
there is considerable difference in the form of the still longer
rostral plate, and the species of <i>Scapanorhynchus</i> differ among
themselves in this regard.</p>

<p><i>Mitsukurina</i>, with <i>Heterodontus</i>, <i>Heptranchias</i>, and <i>Chlamydoselache</i>,
is a very remarkable survival of a very ancient form.
It is an interesting fact that the center of abundance of all
these relics of ancient life is in the Black Current, or Gulf Stream,
of Japan.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Family Alopiid&aelig;, or Thresher Sharks.</b>&mdash;The related family of
<i>Alopiid&aelig;</i> contains probably but one recent species, the great
fox-shark, or thresher, found in all warm seas. In this species,
<i>Alopias vulpes</i>, the tail is as long as the rest of the body and
bent upward from the base. The snout is very short, and
the teeth are small and close-set. The species reaches a length
of about twenty-five feet. It is not especially ferocious, and the
current stories of its attacks on whales probably arise from
a mistake of the observers, who have taken the great killer,
<i>Orca</i>, for a shark. The killer is a mammal, allied to the porpoise.
It attacks the whale with great ferocity, clinging to
its flesh by its strong teeth. The whale rolls over and over,
throwing the killer into the air, and sailors report it as a thresher.
As a matter of fact the thresher very rarely if ever attacks
any animal except small fish. It is said to use its tail in rounding
up and destroying schools of herring and sardines. Fossil
teeth of thresher-sharks of some species are found from the
Miocene.</p>

<p><b>Family Pseudotriakid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The <i>Pseudotriakid&aelig;</i> consist of two
species. One of these is <i>Pseudotriakis microdon</i>, a large shark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
with a long low tail, long and low dorsal fin, and small teeth.
It has been only twice taken, off Portugal and off Long Island.
The other, the mute shark, <i>Pseudotriakis acrales</i>, a large shark
with the body as soft as a rag, is in the museum of Stanford
University, having been taken by Mr. Owston off Misaki.</p>

<p><b>Family Lamnid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;To the family of <i>Lamnid&aelig;</i> proper belong
the swiftest, strongest, and most voracious of all sharks. The
chief distinction lies in the lunate tail, which has a keel on
either side at base, as in the mackerels. This
form is especially favorable for swift swimming,
and it has been independently developed
in the mackerel-sharks, as in the
mackerels, in the interest of speed in movement.</p>

</div>

<p>The porbeagle, <i>Lamna cornubica</i>, known
as salmon-shark in Alaska, has long been
noted for its murderous voracity. About
Kadiak Island it destroys schools of
salmon, and along the coasts of Japan, and
especially of Europe and across to New
England, it makes its evil presence felt among the fishermen.
Numerous fossil species of <i>Lamna</i> occur, known by the long
knife-like flexuous teeth, each having one or two small cusps
at its base.</p>

</div>

<p>In the closely related genus, <i>Isurus</i>, the mackerel-sharks,
this cusp is wanting, while in <i>Isuropsis</i> the dorsal fin is set
farther back. In each of these genera the species reach a
length of 20 to 25 feet. Each is strong, swift, and voracious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
<i>Isurus oxyrhynchus</i> occurs in the Mediterranean, <i>Isuropsis dekayi</i>,
in the Gulf of Mexico, and <i>Isuropsis glauca</i>, from Hawaii and
Japan westward to the Red Sea.</p>

<p><b>Man-eating Sharks.</b>&mdash;Equally swift and vastly stronger than
these mackerel-sharks is the man-eater, or great white shark,
<i>Carcharodon carcharias</i>. This shark, found
occasionally in all warm seas, reaches a length
of over thirty feet and has been known to
devour men. According to Linn&aelig;us, it is the
animal which swallowed the prophet Jonah.
"Jonam Prophetum," he observes, "ut veteris
Herculem trinoctem, in hujus ventriculo tridui
spateo b&aelig;sisse, verosimile est."</p>

</div>

<p>It is beyond comparison the most voracious
of fish-like animals. Near Soquel,
California, the writer obtained a specimen
in 1880, with a young sea-lion (<i>Zalophus</i>) in its stomach.
It has been taken on the coasts of Europe, New England, Carolina,
California, Hawaii, and Japan, its distribution evidently
girdling the globe. The genus <i>Carcharodon</i> is known at once by
its broad, evenly triangular, knife-like teeth, with finely serrated
edges, and without notch or cusp of any kind. But one species
is now living. Fossil teeth are found from the Eocene. One of
these, <i>Carcharodon megalodon</i> (Fig. 332), from fish-guano deposits
in South Carolina and elsewhere, has teeth nearly six inches long.
The animal could not have been less than ninety feet in length.
These huge sharks can be but recently extinct, as their teeth
have been dredged from the sea-bottom by the <i>Challenger</i>
in the mid-Pacific.</p>

<p>Fossil teeth of <i>Lamna</i> and <i>Isurus</i> as well as of <i>Carcharodon</i>
are found in great abundance in Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks.
Among the earlier species are forms which connect these genera
very closely.</p>

<p>The fossil genus <i>Otodus</i> must belong to the <i>Lamnid&aelig;</i>. Its
massive teeth with entire edges and blunt cusps at base are
common in Cretaceous and Tertiary deposits. The teeth are
formed much as in <i>Lamna</i>, but are blunter, heavier, and much
less effective as instruments of destruction. The extinct genus
<i>Corax</i> is also placed here by Woodward.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Family Cetorhinid&aelig;, or Basking Sharks.</b>&mdash;The largest of all
living sharks is the great basking shark (<i>Cetorhinus maximus</i>),
constituting the family of <i>Cetorhinid&aelig;</i>. This is the largest of
all fishes, reaching a length of thirty-six feet and an enormous
weight. It is a dull and sluggish animal of the northern seas,
almost as inert as a sawlog, often floating slowly southward in
pairs in the spring and caught occasionally by whalers for its
liver. When caught, its huge flabby head spreads out wide on
the ground, its weight in connection with the great size of the
mouth-cavity rendering it shapeless. Although so clumsy
and without spirit, it is said that a blow with its tail will crush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
an ordinary whaleboat. The basking shark is known on all
northern coasts, but has most frequently been taken in the
North Sea, and about Monterey Bay in California. From this
locality specimens have been sent to the chief museums of
Europe. In its external characters the basking shark has much
in common with the man-eater. Its body is, however, relatively
clumsy forward; its fins are lower, and its gill-openings
are much broader, almost meeting under the throat. The
great difference lies in the teeth, which in <i>Cetorhinus</i> are very
small and weak, about 200 in each row. The basking shark,
also called elephant-shark and bone-shark, does not pursue its
prey, but feeds on small creatures to be taken without effort.
Fossil teeth of <i>Cetorhinus</i> have been found from the Cretaceous,
as also fossil gill-rakers, structures which in this shark
are so long as to suggest whalebone.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Family Rhineodontid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The whale-sharks, <i>Rhineodontid&aelig;</i>,
are likewise sluggish monsters with feeble teeth and keeled
tails. From <i>Cetorhinus</i> they differ mainly in having the last
gill-opening above the pectorals. There is probably but one
species, <i>Rhineodon typicus</i>, of the tropical Pacific, straying northward
to Florida, Lower California, and Japan.</p>

<p><b>The Carcharioid Sharks, or Requins.</b>&mdash;The largest family of recent
sharks is that of <i>Carchariid&aelig;</i> (often called <i>Galeorhinid&aelig;</i>,
or <i>Galeid&aelig;</i>), a modern offshoot from the Lamnoid type, and
especially characterized by the presence of a third eyelid, the
nictitating membrane, which can be drawn across the eye from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
below. The heterocercal tail has no keel; the end is bent upward;
both dorsal fins are present, and the first is well in front
of the ventral fins; the last gill-opening over the base of the
pectoral, the head normally formed; these sharks are ovoviviparous,
the young being hatched in a sort of uterus, with or
without placental attachment.</p>

<p>Some of these sharks are small, blunt-toothed, and innocuous.
Others reach a very large size and are surpassed in voracity
only by the various <i>Lamnid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>The genera <i>Cynias</i> and <i>Mustelus</i>, comprising the soft-mouthed
or hound-sharks, have the teeth flat and paved, while well-developed
spiracles are present. These small, harmless sharks
abound on almost all coasts in warm regions, and are largely
used as food by those who do not object to the harsh odor of
shark's flesh. The best-known species is <i>Cynias canis</i> of the
Atlantic. By a regular gradation of intermediate forms, through
such genera as <i>Rhinotriacis</i> and <i>Triakis</i> with tricuspid teeth, we
reach the large sharp-toothed members of this family. <i>Galeus</i> (or
<i>Galeorhinus</i>) includes large sharks having spiracles, no pit at the
root of the tail, and with large, coarsely serrated teeth. One
species, the soup-fin shark (<i>Galeus zyopterus</i>), is found on the
coast of California, where its fins are highly valued by the
Chinese, selling at from one to two dollars for each set. The
delicate fin-rays are the part used, these dissolving into a finely
flavored gelatine. The liver of this and other species is used
in making a coarse oil, like that taken from the dogfish. Other
species of <i>Galeus</i> are found in other regions, <i>Galeus galeus</i> being
known in England as tope, <i>Galeus japonicus</i> abounding in Japan.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 334.</span>&mdash;Soup-fin Shark, <i>Galeus zyopterus</i> (Jordan &amp; Gilbert). Monterey.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Galeocerdo</i> differs mainly in having a pit at the root of the
tail. Its species, large, voracious, and tiger-spotted, are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
in warm seas and known as tiger-sharks (<i>Galeocerdo maculatus</i>
in the Atlantic, <i>Galeocerdo tigrinus</i> in the Pacific).</p>

<p>The species of <i>Carcharias</i> (<i>Carcharhinus</i> of Blainville) lack
the spiracles. These species are very numerous, voracious,
armed with sharp teeth, broad or narrow, and finely serrated
on both edges. Some of these sharks reach a length of thirty feet.
They are very destructive to other fishes, and often to fishery
apparatus as well. They are sometimes sought as food, more
often for the oil in their livers, but, as a rule, they are rarely
caught except as a measure for getting rid of them. Of the
many species the best known is the broad-headed <i>Carcharias
lamia</i>, or cub-shark, of the Atlantic. This the writer has taken
with a great hook and chain from the wharves at Key West.
These great sharks swim about harbors in the tropics, acting as
scavengers and occasionally seizing arm or leg of those who
venture within their reach. One species (<i>Carcharias nicaraguensis</i>)
is found in Lake Nicaragua, the only fresh-water shark
known, although some run up the brackish mouth of the Ganges
and into Lake Pontchartrain. <i>Carcharias japonicus</i> abounds in
Japan.</p>

</div>

<p>A closely related genus is <i>Prionace</i>, its species <i>Prionace
glauca</i>, the great blue shark, being slender and swift, with the
dorsal farther back than in <i>Carcharias</i>. Of the remaining
genera the most important is <i>Scoliodon</i>, small sharks with
oblique teeth which have no serrature. One of these, <i>Scoliodon
terr&aelig;-nov&aelig;</i>, is the common sharp-nosed shark of our Carolina
coast. Fossil teeth representing nearly all of these genera
are common in Tertiary rocks.</p>

<p>Probably allied to the <i>Carchariid&aelig;</i> is the genus <i>Corax</i>,
containing large extinct sharks of the Cretaceous with broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>triangular
serrate teeth, very massive in substance, and without
denticles. As only the teeth are known, the actual relations
of the several species of <i>Corax</i>
are not certainly known, and
they may belong to the <i>Lamnid&aelig;</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Family Sphyrnid&aelig;, or Hammer-head
Sharks.</b>&mdash;The <i>Sphyrnid&aelig;</i>,
or hammer-headed sharks,
are exactly like the <i>Carchariid&aelig;</i>
except that the sides of
the head are produced, so as
to give it the shape of a hammer
or of a kidney, the eye
being on the produced outer edge. The species are few, but
mostly widely distributed; rather large, voracious sharks with
small sharp teeth.</p>

<p>The true hammer-head, <i>Sphyrna zyg&aelig;na</i>, Fig. 337, is common
from the Mediterranean to Cape Cod, California, Hawaii, and
Japan. The singular form of its head is one of the most extraordinary
modifications shown among fishes. The bonnet-head
(<i>Sphyrna tiburo</i>) has the head kidney-shaped or crescent-shaped.
It is a smaller fish, but much the same in distribution and habits.
Intermediate forms occur, so that with all the actual differences
we must place the <i>Sphyrnid&aelig;</i> all in one genus. Fossil hammer-heads
occur in the Miocene, but their teeth are scarcely different
from those of <i>Carcharias</i>. <i>Sphyrna prisca</i>, described by Agassiz,
is the primeval species.</p>

<p><b>The Order of Tectospondyli.</b>&mdash;The sharks and rays having no
anal fin and with the calcareous lamell&aelig; arranged in one or
more rings around a central axis constitute a natural group to
which, following Woodward, we may apply the name of <i>Tectospondyli</i>.
The <i>Cyclospondyli</i> (<i>Squalid&aelig;</i>, etc.) with one ring
only of calcareous lamell&aelig; may be included in this order, as
also the rays, which have tectospondylous vertebr&aelig; and differ
from the sharks as a group only in having the gill-openings
relegated to the lower side by the expansion of the pectoral
fins. The group of rays and Hasse's order of <i>Cyclospondyli</i> we
may consider each as a suborder of <i>Tectospondyli</i>. The origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
of this group is probably to be found in or near the <i>Cestraciontes</i>,
as the strong dorsal spines of the <i>Squalid&aelig;</i> resemble those
of the <i>Heterodontid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Suborder Cyclospondyli.</b>&mdash;In this group the vertebr&aelig; have
the calcareous lamell&aelig; arranged in a single ring about the central
axis. The anal fin, as in all the tectospondylous sharks
and rays, is wanting. In all the asterospondylous sharks,
as in the <i>Ichthyotomi</i>, <i>Acanthodei</i>, and <i>Chim&aelig;ras</i>, this fin is
present. It is present in almost all of the bony fishes. All
the species have spiracles, and in all are two dorsal fins. None
have the nictitating membrane, and in all the eggs are hatched
internally. Within the group there is considerable variety
of form and structure. As above stated, we have a perfect
gradation among <i>Tectospondyli</i> from true sharks, with the
gill-openings lateral, to rays, which have the gill-opening on
the ventral side, the great expansion of the pectoral fins, a
character of relatively recent acquisition, having crowded the
gill-openings from their usual position.</p>

<p><b>Family Squalid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The largest and most primitive family
of <i>Cyclospondyli</i> is that of the <i>Squalid&aelig;</i>, collectively known as
dogfishes or skittle-dogs. In the <i>Squalid&aelig;</i> each dorsal fin has
a stout spine in front, the caudal is bent upward and not keeled,
and the teeth are small and varied in form, usually not all alike
in the same jaw.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_545.jpg" width="700" height="179" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 338.</span>&mdash;Dogfish, <i>Squalus acanthias</i> L. Gloucester, Mass.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The genus <i>Squalus</i> includes the dogfishes, small, greedy
sharks abundant in almost all cool seas and in some tropical
waters. They are known by the stout spines in the dorsal fins
and by their sharp, squarish cutting teeth. They are largely
sought by fishermen for the oil in their livers, which is used to
adulterate better oils. Sometimes 20,000 have been taken in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
haul of the net. They are very destructive to herrings and other
food-fishes. Usually the fishermen cut out the liver, throwing
the shark overboard to die or to be cast on the beach. In
northern Europe and New England <i>Squalus acanthias</i> is abundant.
<i>Squalus sucklii</i> replaces it in the waters about Puget
Sound, and <i>Squalus mitsukurii</i> in Japan and Hawaii. Still
others are found in Chile and Australia. The species of <i>Squalus</i>
live near shore and have the gray color usual among sharks.
Allied forms perhaps hardly different from <i>Squalus</i> are found in
the Cretaceous rocks and have been described as <i>Centrophoroides</i>.
Other genera related to <i>Squalus</i> live in greater depths, from 100
to 600 fathoms, and these are violet-black. Some of the deep-water
forms are the smallest of all sharks, scarcely exceeding a
foot in length. <i>Etmopterus spinax</i> lives in the Mediterranean,
and teeth of a similar species occur in the Italian Pliocene
rocks. <i>Etmopterus lucifer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> a deep-water species of Japan, has a
brilliant luminous glandular area along the sides of the belly.
Other small species of deeper waters belong to the genera
<i>Centrophorus</i>, <i>Centroscymnus</i>, and <i>Deania</i>. In some of these
species the scales are highly specialized, pedunculate, or having
the form of serrated leaves. Some species are Arctic, the others
are most abundant about Misaki in Japan and the Madeira
Islands, two regions especially rich in semi-bathybial types.
Allied to the <i>Squalid&aelig;</i> is the small family of <i>Oxynotid&aelig;</i> with
short bodies and strong dorsal spine. <i>Oxynotus centrina</i> is found
in the Mediterranean, and its teeth occur in the Miocene.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Family Dalatiid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The <i>Dalatiid&aelig;</i>, or scymnoid sharks, differ
from the <i>Squalid&aelig;</i> almost solely in the absence of dorsal spines.
The smaller species belonging to <i>Dalatias</i> (<i>Scymnorhinus</i>, or
<i>Scymnus</i>), <i>Dalatias licha</i>, etc., are very much like the dogfishes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></p>
<p>They are, however, nowhere very common. The teeth
of <i>Dalatias major</i> exist in Miocene rocks. In the genus
<i>Somniosus</i> the species are of very much greater size, <i>Somniosus
microcephalus</i> attaining the length of about twenty-five feet.
This species, known as the sleeper-shark or Greenland shark,
lives in all cold seas and is an especial enemy of the whale, from
which it bites large masses of flesh with a ferocity hardly to be
expected from its clumsy appearance. From its habit of feeding
on fish-offal, it is known in New England as "gurry-shark." Its
small quadrate teeth are very much like those of the dogfish,
their tips so turned aside as to form a cutting edge. The species
is stout in form and sluggish in movement. It is taken for
its liver in the north Atlantic on both coasts in Puget Sound
and Bering Sea, and I have seen it in the markets of Tokyo. In
Alaska it abounds about the salmon canneries feeding on the
refuse.</p>

<p><b>Family Echinorhinid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The bramble-sharks, <i>Echinorhinid&aelig;</i>,
differ in the posterior insertion of the very small dorsal fins,
and in the presence of scattered round tubercles, like the thorns
of a bramble instead of shagreen. The single species, <i>Echinorhinus
spinosus</i> reaches a large size. It is rather
scarce on the coasts of Europe, and was once
taken on Cape Cod. The teeth of an extinct
species, <i>Echinorhinus richardi</i>, are found in the
Pliocene.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 340.</span>&mdash;Brain of
Monkfish, <i>Squatina
squatina</i> L. (After
Dum&eacute;ril.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Suborder Rhin&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The suborder <i>Rhin&aelig;</i> includes
those sharks having the vertebr&aelig; tectospondylous,
that is, with two or more series of
calcified lamell&aelig;, as on the rays. They are
transitional forms, as near the rays as the
sharks, although having the gill-openings rather
lateral than inferior, the great pectoral fins
being separated by a notch from the head.</p>

<p>The principal family is that of the angel-fishes,
or monkfishes (<i>Squatinid&aelig;</i>). In this
group the body is depressed and flat like that
of a ray. The greatly enlarged pectorals form
a sort of shoulder in front alongside of the
gill-openings, which has suggested the bend of the angel's wing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
The dorsals are small and far back, the tail is slender with
small fins, all these being characters shared by the rays. But
one genus is now extant, widely diffused in warm seas. The
species if really distinct are all very close to the European
<i>Squatina squatina</i>. This is a moderate-sized shark of sluggish
habit feeding on crabs and shells, which it crushes with its
small, pointed, nail-shaped teeth. Numerous fossil species of
<i>Squatina</i> are found from the Triassic and Cretaceous, <i>Squatina
alifera</i> being the best known.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Family Pristiophorid&aelig;, or Saw-sharks.</b>&mdash;Another highly aberrant
family is that of the sawsharks, <i>Pristiophorid&aelig;</i>. These are
small sharks, much like the <i>Dalatiid&aelig;</i> in appearance, but with the
snout produced into a long flat blade, on either side of which is a
row of rather small sharp enameled teeth. These teeth are smaller
and sharper than in the sawfish (<i>Pristis</i>), and the whole animal
is much smaller than its analogue among the rays. This saw
must be an effective weapon among the schools of herring and
anchovies on which the sawsharks feed. The true teeth are
small, sharp, and close-set. The few species of sawsharks
are marine, inhabiting the shores of eastern Asia and Australia.
<i>Pristiophorus japonicus</i> is found rather sparsely along
the shores of Japan. The vertebr&aelig; in this group are also tectospondylous.
Both the <i>Squatina</i> and <i>Pristiophorus</i> represent a
perfect transition from the sharks and rays. We regard them
as sharks only because the gill-openings are on the side, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
crowded downward to the under side of the body-disk. As
fossil, <i>Pristiophorus</i> is known only from a few detached vertebr&aelig;
found in Germany.</p>

<p><b>Suborder Batoidei, or Rays.</b>&mdash;The suborder of <i>Batoidei</i>, <i>Raj&aelig;</i>,
or <i>Hypotrema</i>, including the skates and rays, is a direct modern
offshoot from the ancestors of tectospondylous sharks, its characters
all specialized in the direction of life on the bottom with
a food of shells, crabs, and other creatures less active than fishes.</p>

<p>The single tangible distinctive character of the rays as a
whole lies in the position of the gill-openings, which are directly
below the disk and not on the side of the neck in all the sharks.
This difference in position is produced by the anterior encroachment
of the large pectoral fins, which are more or less attached to
the side of the head. By this arrangement, which aids in giving
the body the form of a flat disk, the gill-openings are limited
and forced downward. In the <i>Squatinid&aelig;</i> (angel-fishes) and
the <i>Pristiophorid&aelig;</i> (sawsharks) the gill-openings have an intermediate
position, and these families might well be referred to
the <i>Batoidei</i>, with which group they agree in the tectospondylous
vertebr&aelig;.</p>

<p>Other characters of the rays, appearing progressively, are
the widening of the disk, through the greater and greater development
of the fins, the reduction of the tail, which in the
more specialized forms becomes a long whip, the reduction, more
and more posterior insertion, and the final loss of the dorsal
fins, which are always without spine, the reduction of the teeth
to a tessellated pavement, then finally to flat plates and the
retention of the large spiracle. Through this spiracle the rays
breathe while lying on the bottom, thus avoiding the danger of
introducing sand into their gills, as would be done if they
breathed through the mouth. In common with the cyclospondylous
sharks, all the rays lack the anal fin. The rays rarely
descend to great depths in the sea. The different members
have varying relations, but the group most naturally divides
into thick-tailed rays or skates (<i>Sarcura</i>) and whip-tailed rays
or sting-rays (<i>Masticura</i>). The former are much nearer to the
sharks and also appear earliest in geological times.</p>

<p><b>Pristidid&aelig;, or Sawfishes.</b>&mdash;The sawfishes, <i>Pristidid&aelig;</i>, are long,
shark-like rays of large size, having, like the sawsharks, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
snout prolonged into a very long and strong flat blade, with
a series of strong enameled teeth implanted in sockets along
either side of it. These teeth are much larger and much less
sharp than in the sawsharks, but they are certainly homologous
with these, and the two groups must have a common descent,
distinct from that of the other rays. Doubtless when
taxonomy is a more refined art they will constitute a small
suborder together. This character of enameled teeth on the
snout would seem of more importance than the position of the
gill-openings or even the flattening and expansion of the body.
The true teeth in the sawfishes are blunt and close-set, pavement-like
as befitting a ray. (See Fig. 152.)</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 342.</span>&mdash;Sawfish, <i>Pristis pectinatus</i> Latham. Pensacola, Fla.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The sawfishes are found chiefly in river-mouths of tropical
America and West Africa: <i>Pristis pectinatus</i> in the West
Indies; <i>Pristis zephyreus</i> in western Mexico; and <i>Pristis pectinatus</i>
in the Senegal. They reach a length of ten to twenty feet,
and with their saws they make great havoc among the schools
of mullets and sardines on which they feed. The stories of
their attacks on the whale are without foundation. The writer
has never found any of the species in the open sea. They
live chiefly in the brackish water of estuaries and river-mouths.</p>

<p>Fossil teeth of sawfishes occur in abundance in the Eocene.
Still older are vertebr&aelig; from the Upper Cretaceous at Maestricht.
In <i>Propristis schweinfurthi</i> the tooth-sockets are
not yet calcified. In <i>Sclerorhynchus atavus</i>, from the Upper
Cretaceous, the teeth are complex in form, with a "crimped"
or stellate base and a sharp, backward-directed enameled crown.</p>

<p><b>Rhinobatid&aelig;, or Guitar-fishes.</b>&mdash;The <i>Rhinobatid&aelig;</i> (guitar-fishes)
are long-bodied, shovel-nosed rays, with strong tails; they
are ovoviviparous, hatching the eggs within the body. The body,
like that of the shark or sawfish, is covered with nearly uniform
shagreen. The numerous species abound in all warm seas; they
are olive-gray in color and feed on small animals of the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>bottoms.
The length of the snout differs considerably in
different species, but in all the body is relatively long and strong.
Most of the species belong to <i>Rhinobatus</i>. The best-known
American species are <i>Rhinobatus lentiginosus</i> of Florida and
<i>Rhinobatus productus</i> of California. The names guitar-fish,
fiddler-fish, etc., refer to the form of the body. Numerous
fossil species, allied to the recent forms, occur from the Jurassic.
Species much like <i>Rhinobatus</i> occur in the Cretaceous and Eocene.
<i>Tamiobatis vetustus</i>, lately described by Dr. Eastman from a
skull found in the Devonian of eastern Kentucky, the oldest
ray-like fish yet known, is doubtless the type of a distinct
family, <i>Tamiobatid&aelig;</i>. It is more likely a shark however than
a ray, although the skull has a flattened ray-like form.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 343.</span>&mdash;Guitar-fish, <i>Rhinobatus lentiginosus</i> Garman. Charleston, S. C.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Closely related to the <i>Rhinobatid&aelig;</i> are the <i>Rhinid&aelig;</i> (<i>Rhamphobatid&aelig;</i>),
a small family of large rays shaped like the guitar-fishes
and found on the coast of Asia. <i>Rhina ancylostoma</i>
extends northward to Japan.</p>

<p>In the extinct family of <i>Astrodermid&aelig;</i>, allied to the <i>Rhinobatid&aelig;</i>,
the tail has two smooth spines and the skin is covered
with tubercles. In <i>Belemnobatis sismond&aelig;</i> the tubercles are
conical; in <i>Astrodermus platypterus</i> they are stellate.</p>

<p><b>Rajid&aelig;, or Skates.</b>&mdash;The <i>Rajid&aelig;</i>, skates, or rays, inhabit the
colder waters of the globe and are represented by a large number
of living species. In this family the tail is stout, with two-rayed
dorsal fins and sometimes a caudal fin. The skin is
variously armed with spines, there being always in the male two
series of specialized spinous hooks on the outer edge of the
pectoral fin. There is no serrated spine or "sting," and in
all the species the eggs are laid in leathery cases, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
"wheelbarrow-shaped," with a projecting tube at each of the
four angles. The size of this egg-case depends on the size of
the species, ranging from three to about eight inches in length.
In some species more than one egg is included in the same case.</p>

<p>Most of the species belong to the typical genus <i>Raja</i>, and
these are especially numerous on the coasts of all northern
regions, where they are largely used as food. The flesh, although
rather coarse and not well flavored, can be improved by hot
butter, and as "raie au beurre noir" is appreciated by the
epicure. The rays of all have small rounded teeth, set in a close
pavement.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 344.</span>&mdash;Common Skate, <i>Raja erinacea</i> Mitchill. Woods Hole, Mass.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Some of the species, known on our coasts as "barn-door
skates," reach a length of four or five feet. Among these are
<i>Raja l&aelig;vis</i> and <i>Raja ocellata</i> on our Atlantic coast, <i>Raja binoculata</i>
in California, and <i>Raja tengu</i> in Japan. The small tobacco-box
skate, brown with black spots, abundant on the New England
coast, is <i>Raja erinacea</i>. The corresponding species in California
is <i>Raja inornata</i>, and in Japan <i>Raja kenojei</i>. Numerous
other species, <i>Raja batis</i>, <i>clavata</i>, <i>circularis</i>, <i>fullonica</i>, etc.,
occur on the coasts of Europe. Some species are variegated in
color, with eye-like spots or jet-black marblings. Still others,
living in deep waters, are jet-black with the body very soft and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
limp. For these Garman has proposed the generic name <i>Malacorhinus</i>,
a name which may come into general use when the
species are better known. In the deep seas rays are found
even under the equator. In the south-temperate zone the
species are mostly generically distinct, <i>Psammobatis</i> being a
typical form, differing from <i>Raja</i>. <i>Discobatus sinensis</i>, common
in China and Japan, is a shagreen-covered form, looking
like a <i>Rhinobatus</i>. It is, however, a true ray, laying its eggs
in egg-cases, and with the pectorals extending on the snout.
Fossil <i>Rajid&aelig;</i>, known by the teeth and bony tubercles, are
found from the Cretaceous onward. They belong to <i>Raja</i> and
to the extinct genera <i>Dynatobatis</i>, <i>Oncobatis</i>, and <i>Acanthobatis</i>.
The genus <i>Arthropterus</i> (<i>rileyi</i>) from the Lias, known from a
large pectoral fin, with distinct cylindrical-jointed rays, may
have been one of the <i>Rajid&aelig;</i>, or perhaps the type of a distinct
family, <i>Arthropterid&aelig;</i>.</p>

Pensacola, Fla.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Narcobatid&aelig;, or Torpedoes.</b>&mdash;The torpedoes, or electric rays
(<i>Narcobatid&aelig;</i>), are characterized by the soft, perfectly smooth
skin, by the stout tail with rayed fins, and by the ovoviviparous
habit, the eggs being hatched internally. In all the species is
developed an elaborate electric organ, muscular in its origin
and composed of many hexagonal cells, each filled with soft
fluid. These cells are arranged under the skin about the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
of the head and at the base of the pectoral fin, and are capable
of benumbing an enemy by means of a severe electric shock.
The exercise of this power soon exhausts the animal, and a
certain amount of rest is essential to recovery.</p>

<p>The torpedoes, also known as crampfishes or numbfishes,
are peculiarly soft to the touch and rather limp, the substance
consisting largely of watery or fatty tissues. They are found
in all warm seas. They are not often abundant, and as food
they have not much value.</p>

<p>Perhaps the largest species is <i>Tetronarce occidentalis</i>, the
crampfish of our Atlantic coast, black in color, and said sometimes
to weigh 200 pounds. In California <i>Tetronarce californica</i>
reaches a length of three feet and is very rarely taken,
in warm sandy bays. <i>Tetronarce nobiliana</i> in Europe is much
like these two American species. In the European species,
<i>Narcobatus torpedo</i>, the spiracles are fringed and the animal
is of smaller size. To <i>Narcine</i> belong the smaller numbfish,
or "entemedor," of tropical America. These have the spiracles
close behind the eyes, not at a distance as in <i>Narcobatus</i> and
<i>Tetronarce</i>. <i>Narcine brasiliensis</i> is found throughout the West
Indies, and <i>Narcine entemedor</i> in the Gulf of California. <i>Astrape</i>,
a genus with but one dorsal fin, is common in southern Japan.
Fossil <i>Narcobatus</i> and <i>Astrape</i> occur in the Eocene, one specimen
of the former nearly five feet long. Vertebr&aelig; of <i>Astrape</i>
occur in Prussia in the amber-beds.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Petalodontid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;Near the <i>Squatinid&aelig;</i>, between the sharks
and the rays, Woodward places the large extinct family of
<i>Petalodontid&aelig;</i>, with coarsely paved
teeth each of which is elongate
with a central ridge and one or
more strong roots at base. The
best-known genera are <i>Janassa</i> and
<i>Petalodus</i>, widely distributed in
Carboniferous time. <i>Janassa</i> is
a broad flat shark, or, perhaps,
a skate, covered with smooth
shagreen. The large pectoral fins
are grown to the head; the rather
large ventral fins are separated from them. The tail is small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
and the fins, as in the rays, are without spines. The teeth
bear some resemblance to those of <i>Myliobatis</i>. <i>Janassa</i> is found
in the coal-measures of Europe
and America, and other genera
extend upward from the Subcarboniferous
limestones, disappearing
near the end of Carboniferous
time. <i>Petalodus</i> is
equally common, but known
only from the teeth. Other
widely distributed genera are <i>Ctenoptychius</i> and <i>Polyrhizodus</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>These forms may be intermediate between the skates and
the sting-rays. In dentition they resemble most the latter.</p>

<p>Similar to these is the extinct family of <i>Pristodontid&aelig;</i> with
one large tooth in each jaw, the one hollowed out to meet the
other. It is supposed that but two teeth existed in life, but
that is not certain. Nothing is known of the rest of the body
in <i>Pristodus</i>, the only genus of the group.</p>

<p><b>Dasyatid&aelig;, or Sting-rays.</b>&mdash;In the section <i>Masticura</i> the tail
is slender, mostly whip-like, without rayed dorsal or caudal
fins, and it is usually armed with a very long spine with saw-teeth
projecting backward. In the typical forms this is a
very effective weapon, being wielded with great force and making
a jagged wound which in man rarely heals without danger of
blood-poisoning. There is no specific poison, but the slime
and the loose cuticle of the spine serve to aggravate the irregular
cut. I have seen one sting-ray thrust this spine through
the body of another lying near it in a boat. Occasionally two
or three of these spines are present. In the more specialized
forms of sting-rays this spine loses its importance. It becomes
very small and not functional, and is then occasionally
or even generally absent in individuals.</p>

<p>The common sting-rays, those in which the caudal spine
is most developed, belong to the family of <i>Dasyatid&aelig;</i>. This
group is characterized by the small skate-like teeth and by
the non-extension of the pectoral rays on the head. The skin is
smooth or more or less rough. These animals lie flat on the sandy
bottoms in nearly all seas, feeding on crabs and shellfish. All
hatch the eggs within the body. The genus <i>Urolophus</i> has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
rounded disk, and a stout, short tail with a caudal fin. It has a
strong spine, and for its size is the most dangerous of the sting-rays.
<i>Urolophus halleri</i>, the California species, was named for a
young man who was stung by the species at the time of its first
discovery at San Diego in 1863. <i>Urolophus jamaicensis</i> abounds
in the West Indies, <i>Urolophus mundus</i> at Panama, and <i>Urolophus
fuscus</i> in Japan. None of the species reach Europe. The
true sting-ray (stingaree, or clam-cracker), <i>Dasyatis</i>, is more
widely diffused and the species are very closely related. In
these species the body is angular and the tail whip-like. Some
of the species reach a length of ten or twelve feet. None have
any economic value, and all are disliked by fishermen. <i>Dasyatis
pastinaca</i> is common in Europe, <i>Dasyatis centrura</i> along our
Atlantic coast, <i>Dasyatis sabina</i> ascends the rivers of Florida,
and <i>Dasyatis dipterura</i> abounds in the bay of San Diego. Other
species are found in tropical America, while still others (<i>Dasyatis
akajei</i>, <i>kuhlii</i>, <i>zugei</i>, etc.) swarm in Japan and across India to
Zanzibar.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 348.</span>&mdash;Sting-ray, <i>Dasyatis sabina</i> Le Sueur. Galveston.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Pteroplatea</i>, the butterfly-ray, has the disk very much broader
than long, and the trivial tail is very short, its little spine more
often lost than present. Different species of this genus circle
the globe: <i>Pteroplatea maclura</i>, on our Atlantic coast; <i>Pteroplatea
marmorata</i>, in California; <i>Pteroplatea japonica</i>, in Japan;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
and <i>Pteroplatea altavela</i>, in Europe. They are all very much
alike, olive, with the brown upper surface pleasingly mottled
and spotted.</p>

<p>Sting-rays of various types, <i>T&aelig;niura</i>, <i>Urolophus</i>, etc., occur
as fossils from the Eocene onward. A complete skeleton called
<i>Xiphotrygon acutidens</i>, distinguished from <i>Dasyatis</i> by its
sharp teeth, is described by Cope from the Eocene of Twin Creek
in Wyoming. Vertebr&aelig; of <i>Urolophus</i> are found in German Eocene.
<i>Cyclobatis</i> (<i>oligodactylus</i>), allied to <i>Urolophus</i>, with a few long
pectoral rays greatly produced, extending over the tail and
forming a rayed wreath-like projection over the snout, is known
from the Lower Cretaceous.</p>

<p><b>Myliobatid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The eagle-rays, <i>Myliobatid&aelig;</i>, have the pectoral
fins extended to the snout, where they form a sort of rayed
pad. The teeth are very large, flat, and laid in mosaic. The
whip-like tail is much like that in the <i>Dasyatid&aelig;</i>, but the spine
is usually smaller. The eagle-like appearance is suggested
by the form of the skull. The eyes are on the side of the head
with heavy eyebrows above them. The species are destructive
to clams and oysters, crushing them with their strong flat teeth.</p>

<p>In <i>A&euml;tobatus</i> the teeth are very large, forming but one row.
The species <i>A&euml;tobatus narinari</i> is showily colored, brown with
yellow spots, the body very angular, with long whip-like tail.
It is found from Brazil to Hawaii and is rather common.</p>

<p>In <i>Myliobatis</i> the teeth are in several series. The species
are many, and found in all warm seas. <i>Myliobatis aquila</i> is
the eagle-ray of Europe, <i>Myliobatis californicus</i> is the batfish of
California, and <i>Myliobatis tobijei</i> takes its place in Japan.</p>

<p>In <i>Rhinoptera</i> the snout is notched and cross-notched in
front so that it appears as if ending in four lobes at the tip.
These "cow-nosed rays," or "whipparees," root up the soft
bottoms of shallow bays in their search for clams, much as a
drove of hogs would do it. The common American species
is <i>Rhinopterus bonasus</i>. <i>Rhinoptera steindachneri</i> lives in the
Gulf of California.</p>

<p>Teeth and spines of all these genera are common as fossils
from the Eocene onwards, as well as many of the extinct genus,
<i>Ptychodus</i>, with cyclospondylous vertebr&aelig;. <i>Ptychodus mammilaris</i>,
<i>rugosus</i>, and <i>decurrens</i> are characteristic of the Creta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>ceous
of England. <i>Myliobatis dixoni</i> is common in the European
Eocene, as is also <i>Myliobatis toliapicus</i> and <i>A&euml;tobatis
irregularis</i>. <i>Apocopodon seriacus</i> is known from the Cretaceous
of Brazil.</p>

<p><b>Family Psammodontid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The <i>Psammodontid&aelig;</i> are known
only from the teeth, large, flat, or rounded and finely dotted or
roughened on the upper surface, as the name <i>Psammodus</i> (&#968;&#8049;&#956;&#956;&#959;&#962;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
sand; &#8000;&#948;&#959;&#8059;&#962;, tooth) would indicate. The way in which the
jaws lie indicates that these teeth belonged to rays rather than
sharks. Numerous species have been described, mostly from
the Subcarboniferous limestones. <i>Arch&aelig;obatis gigas</i>, perhaps,
as its name would indicate, the primeval skate, is from the
Subcarboniferous limestone of Greencastle, Indiana. Teeth
of numerous species of <i>Psammodus</i> and <i>Copodus</i> are found in
many rocks of Carboniferous age. <i>Psammodus rugosus</i> common
in Carboniferous rocks of Europe.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Family Mobulid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The sea-devils, <i>Mobulid&aelig;</i>, are the mightiest
of all the rays, characterized by the development of the anterior
lobe of the pectorals as a pair of cephalic fins. These stand
up like horns or cars on the upper part of the head. The teeth
are small and flat, tubercular, and the whip-like tail is with
or without spine. The species are few, little known, and inordinately
large, reaching a width of more than twenty feet
and a weight, according to Risso, of 1250 pounds. When harpooned
it is said that they will drag a large boat with great
swiftness. The manta, or sea-devil, of tropical America is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
<i>Manta birostris</i>. It is said to be much dreaded by the pearl-fishers,
who fear that it will devour them "after enveloping
them in its vast wings." It is not likely, however, that the
manta devours anything larger than the pearl-oyster itself.
<i>Manta hamiltoni</i> is a name given to a sea-devil of the Gulf of
California. The European species <i>Mobula edentula</i> reaches a
similarly enormous size, and <i>Mobula hypostoma</i> has been scantily
described from Jamaica and Brazil. <i>Mobula japonica</i> occurs
in Japan. A f&oelig;tus in my possession from a huge specimen
taken at Misaki is nearly a foot across. In <i>Mobula</i> (<i>Cephaloptera</i>)
there are teeth in both jaws, in <i>Manta</i> (<i>Ceratoptera</i>) in the lower
jaw only. In <i>Ceratobatis</i> from Jamaica (<i>C. robertsi</i>) there are
teeth in the upper jaw only. Otherwise the species of the three
genera are much alike, and from their huge size are little known
and rarely seen in collections. Of <i>Mobulid&aelig;</i> no extinct species
are known.</p>

THE HOLOCEPHALI, OR CHIM&AElig;RAS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_561.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Chim&aelig;ras.</b>&mdash;Very early in geological times, certainly
as early as the middle Silurian, the type of
<i>Chim&aelig;ras</i> diverged from that of the sharks. Hasse
derives them directly from his hypothetical primitive <i>Polyospondyli</i>,
by way of the <i>Acanthodei</i> and <i>Ichthyotomi</i>. In any
event the point of divergence must be placed very early in the
evolution of sharks, and this suggestion is as likely as any other.
The chief character of Chim&aelig;ras is found in the autostylic skull,
which is quite different from the hyostylic skull of the sharks.
In the sharks and in all higher fishes the mandible is joined to the
skull by a suspensorium of bones or cartilages (quadrate, symplectic,
and hyomandibular bones in the Teleost fishes). To this
arrangement the name hyostylic is given. In the Chim&aelig;ra there
is no suspensorium, the mandible being directly attached to
the cranium, of which the hyomandibular and quadrate elements
form an integral part, this arrangement being called autostylic.
The palato-quadrate apparatus, of which the upper jaw is the
anterior part, is immovably fused with the cranium, instead
of being articulated with it. This fact, gives the name to the
subclass <i>Holocephali</i> (&#8005;&#955;&#959;&#962;, whole or solid; &#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#8053;, head).
Other characters are found in the incomplete character of the
back-bone, which consists of a scarcely segmented notochord
differing from the most primitive condition imagined only
in being surrounded by calcareous rings, no lime entering into
the composition of the notochord itself. The tail is diphycercal
and usually prolonged in a filament (leptocercal). The shoulder-girdle,
as in the sharks, is free from the skull. The pectoral
fins are short and broad, without segmented axis or archiptery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>gium
and without recognizable analogue of the three large
cartilages seen in the sharks, the propterygium, mesopterygium,
and metapterygium. In the mouth, instead of teeth, are developed
flat, bony plates called tritors or grinders, set endwise
in the front of the jaws. The gills are fringe-like, free at the
tips as in ordinary fishes, and there is a single external opening
for them all as in true fishes, and they are covered with a flap
of skin. These structures are, however, quite different from
those of the true fishes and are doubtless independently developed.
There is no spiracle. The skin is smooth or rough.
In the living forms and most of the extinct species there is a
strong spine in the dorsal fin. The ventral fin in the male has
complex, usually trifid, claspers, and an analogous organ, the
cephalic holder, is developed on the front of the head, in the
adult male. This is a bony hook with a brush of glistening
enameled teeth at the end. The eggs are large, and laid in
oblong or elliptical egg-cases, provided with silky filaments.
The eggs are fertilized after they are extruded. Mucous channels
and lateral line are highly developed, being most complex
about the head. The brain is essentially shark-like, the optic
nerves form a chiasma, and the central hemispheres are large.</p>

<p>The teeth of the Chim&aelig;ras are thus described by Woodward,
vol. 2, pp. 36, 37:</p>

<p>"In all the known families of Chim&aelig;roids, the dentition
consists of a few large plates of vascular dentine, of which
certain areas ('tritors') are specially hardened by the deposition
of calcareous salts within and around groups of medullary
canals, which rise at right angles to the functional surface. In
most cases there is a single pair of such plates in the lower jaw,
meeting at the symphysis, while two pairs are arranged to
oppose these above. As a whole, the dentition thus closely
resembles that of the typical Dipnoi (as has often been pointed
out); and the upper teeth may be provisionally named palatine
and vomerine until further discoveries shall have revealed
their precise homologies. The structures are sometimes described
as 'jaws,' and regarded as dentaries, maxill&aelig;, and
premaxill&aelig;, but the presence of a permanent pulp under each
tooth is conclusive proof of their bearing no relation to the
familiar membrane-bones thus named in higher fishes."</p>

<p><b>Relationship of Chim&aelig;ras.</b>&mdash;As to the origin of the Chim&aelig;ras
and their relation to the sharks, Dr. Dean has this recent ("The
Devonian Lamprey") and interesting word:</p>

<p>"The Holocephali have always been a doubtful group,
anatomy and pal&aelig;ontology contributing but imperfect evidence
as to their position in the gnathostome phylum. Their embryology,
however, is still undescribed, except in a brief note
by T. J. Parker, and it is reasonably looked to to contribute
evidence as to their line of descent. The problem of the relationships
of the Chim&aelig;roids has long been of especial interest to
me, and it has led me to obtain embryonic material of a Pacific
species of one of these forms. It may be of interest in this
connection to state that the embryology of this form gives
the clearest evidence that the wide separation of the Selachii
and Holocephali is not tenable. The entire plan of development
in <i>Chim&aelig;ra colliei</i> is clearly like that of a shark. The
ovulation is closely like that of certain of the rays and sharks:
the eggs are large, the segmentation is distinctly shark-like;
the circular blastoderm overgrows the yolk in an elasmobranchian
manner. The early embryos are shark-like; and the later
ones have, as T. J. Parker has shown, external gills, and I note
further that these arise, precisely as in shark-embryos, from the
posterior margin of the gill-bar. A spiracle also is present.
A further and most interesting developmental feature is the
fact that the autostylism in <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i> is purely of secondary
nature and is at the most of ordinal value. It is found that
in a larva of <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i> measuring 45 mm. in length, the
palato-quadrate cartilage is still separated from the skull by
a wide fissure. This becomes gradually reduced by the confluence
of the palato-quadrate cartilage with the skull, the
fusion taking place at both the anterior and posterior ends of
the mesal rim of the cartilage. The remains of the fissure are
still well marked in the young <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i>, four inches in length;
and a rudiment of it is present in the adult skull as a passage-way
for a nerve. Regarding the dentition: it may also be
noted in the present connection that the growth of the dental
plates in <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i> suggests distinctly elasmobranchian conditions.
Thus on the roof of the mouth the palatine plates
are early represented by a series of small more or less conical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
elements which resemble outwardly, at least, the 'anlagen'
of the pavement teeth in cestraciont sharks."</p>

</div>

<p><b>Family Chim&aelig;rid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The existing Chim&aelig;ras are known also
as spookfishes, ratfishes, and elephant-fishes. These are divided
by Garman into three families, and in the principal family, the
<i>Chim&aelig;rid&aelig;</i>, the snout is blunt, the skin without plates, and
the dorsal fin is provided with a long spine. The flat tritors
vary in the different genera. The single genus represented
among living fishes is <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i>, found in cold seas and in the
oceanic depths. The best-known species, <i>Chim&aelig;ra colliei</i>, the
elephant-fish, or chim&aelig;ra of California, abounds in shallow
waters of ten to twenty fathoms from Sitka to San Diego.
It is a harmless fish, useless except for the oil in its liver, and
of special interest to anatomists as the only member of the
family to be found when desired for dissection. This species
was first found at Monterey by Mr. Collie, naturalist of Captain
Beechey's ship, the <i>Blossom</i>. It is brown in color, with whitish
spots, and reaches a length of 2&frac12; feet. As a shallow-water
form, with certain differences in the claspers and in the tail,
<i>Chim&aelig;ra colliei</i> is sometimes placed in a distinct genus, <i>Hydrolagus</i>.
Other species inhabit much greater depths and have
the tail produced into a long filament. Of these, <i>Chim&aelig;ra
monstrosa</i>, the sea-cat of the north Atlantic, has been longer
known than any other Chim&aelig;ra. <i>Chim&aelig;ra affinis</i> has been
dredged in the Gulf Stream and off Portugal. <i>Chim&aelig;ra phantasma</i>
and <i>Chim&aelig;ra mitsukurii</i> are frequently taken in Japan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
and the huge jet-black <i>Chim&aelig;ra purpurascens</i> in Hawaii and
Japan. None of these species are valued as food, but all impress
the spectator with their curious forms.</p>

</div>

<p>The fossil <i>Chim&aelig;rid&aelig;</i>, although numerous from Triassic
times and referred to several genera, are known chiefly by their
teeth with occasional fin-spines, frontal holders, or impressions
of parts of the skeleton. The earliest of <i>chim&aelig;roid</i> remains has
been described by Dr. Charles D. Walcott<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> from Ordovician
or Lower Silurian rocks at Ca&ntilde;on City, Colorado. Of the species
called <i>Dictyorhabdus priscus</i>, only parts supposed to be the
sheath of the notochord have been preserved. Dr. Dean thinks
this more likely to be part of the axis of a cephalopod shell.
The definitely known <i>Chim&aelig;rid&aelig;</i> are mainly confined to the
rocks of the Mesozoic and subsequent eras. <i>Ischyodus priscus</i>
(<i>avitus</i>) of the lower Jura resembles a modern chim&aelig;ra.
<i>Granodus oweni</i> is another extinct chim&aelig;ra, and numerous
fin-spines, teeth, and other fragments in the Cretaceous and
Eocene of America and Europe are referred to <i>Edaphodon</i>. A
species of <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i> has been recorded from the Pliocene of
Tuscany, and one of <i>Callorhynchus</i> from the greensand of New
Zealand. Other American Cretaceous genera of chim&aelig;roids are
<i>Mylognathus</i>, <i>Bryactinus</i>, <i>Isot&aelig;nia</i>, <i>Leptomylus</i>, and <i>Sphagep&oelig;a</i>.
Dental plates called <i>Rhynchodus</i> are found in the Devonian.</p>

<p><b>Rhinochim&aelig;rid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The most degenerate of existing chim&aelig;ras
belong to the family of <i>Rhinochim&aelig;rid&aelig;</i>, characterized by the
long flat soft blade in which the snout terminates. This structure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>resembles that seen in the deep-sea shark, <i>Mitsukurina</i>,
and in <i>Polyodon</i>. In <i>Rhinochim&aelig;ra pacifica</i> of Japan the teeth
in each jaw form but a single plate. In <i>Harriotta raleighana</i>,
of the Gulf Stream, they are more nearly as in <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i>. Both
are bathybial fishes, soft in texture, and found in great depths.
The family of <i>Callorhynchid&aelig;</i>, or Antarctic Chim&aelig;ras, includes
the bottle-nosed Chim&aelig;ra (<i>Callorhynchus callorhynchus</i>) of the
Patagonian region. In this species the snout is also produced,
a portion being turned backward below in front of the mouth,
forming a sensory pad well supplied with nerves.</p>

<p><b>Extinct Chim&aelig;roids.</b>&mdash;According to Woodward, three other
families are recognizable among the extinct forms.</p>

<p>The <i>Ptyctodontid&aelig;</i> are known from the teeth only, a single
pair of large, laterally compressed dental plates in each jaw,
with a few hard tritoral areas. These occur in Silurian and
Devonian rocks. <i>Ptyctodus obliquus</i> from the Devonian of
Russia is the best-known species. Other genera are <i>Rhynchodus</i>
and <i>Pal&aelig;omylus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Squalorajid&aelig;</i> have the head depressed and the snout
produced in a flat rostrum, as in <i>Harriotta</i>. There is no dorsal
spine, and the teeth are a few thin curved plates. The frontal
holder of the male is well developed. The few species occur in
the Lias. <i>Squaloraja dolichognathos</i> is known from numerous
fragments from the Triassic in England and Scotland. <i>Chalcodus
permianus</i> is found in German Permian.</p>

<p>The <i>Myriacanthid&aelig;</i> have the body elongate, with dermal
plates on the head and a long straight spine in the dorsal fin.
The frontal holder is large. The species, few in number, are
found in Mesozoic rocks. <i>Myriacanthus paradoxus</i> is the best-known
species. Of another species, <i>Chim&aelig;ropsis paradoxa</i>,
a skeleton about three feet long has been found which shows
a number of peculiar traits. The skin is covered with ribbed
shagreen scales. The dorsal fin has a large spine with retrorse
serrations behind. The tail is slim, and the pectoral and ventral
fins are very large. Bony plates with conical spines protect
the neck. The teeth are large and angular, of peculiar form.</p>

<p><b>Ichthyodorulites.</b>&mdash;The term ichthyodorulite (&#7984;&#967;&#952;&#8059;&#962;, fish; &#948;&#8057;&#961;&#965;,
lance; &#955;&#8055;&#952;&#959;&#962;, stone) is applied to detached fin-spines, dermal
spines, and tubercles belonging to unrecognized species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
sharks and chim&aelig;ras. Some of these are serrated, others
entire, some straight, some curved, and some with elaborate
armature or sculpture. Some doubtless belong to <i>Cestraciontes</i>,
others to <i>Pleuracanthid&aelig;</i>; some to <i>Squalid&aelig;</i>, some to chim&aelig;ras,
and others, perhaps, to forms still altogether unknown.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Ostracophores</span>.</b>&mdash;Among the earliest vertebrates actually
recognized as fossils belongs the group known as
<i>Ostracophori</i> (&#8004;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#962;, a box; &#966;&#959;&#961;&#8051;&#969;, to bear). These
are most extraordinary creatures, jawless, apparently limbless,
and enveloped in most cases anteriorly in a coat of mail.
In typical forms the head is very broad, bony, and horseshoe-shaped,
attached to a slender body, often scaly, with small
fins and ending in a heterocercal tail. What the mouth was
like can only be guessed, but no trace of jaws has yet been
found in connection with it. The most remarkable distinctive
character is found in the absence of jaws and limbs in connection
with the bony armature. The latter is, however, sometimes
obsolete. The back-bone, as usual in primitive fishes, is developed
as a persistent notochord imperfectly segmented. The
entire absence of jaw structures, as well as the character of the
armature, at once separates them widely from the mailed <i>Arthrodires</i>
of a later period. But it is by no means certain that
these structures were not represented by soft cartilage, of which
no traces have been preserved in the specimens known.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Nature of the Ostracophores.</b>&mdash;The Ostracophores are found
in the Ordovician or Lower Silurian rocks, in the Upper Silurian,
and in the Devonian. After the latter period they disappear.
The species are very numerous and varied. Their
real affinities have been much disputed. Zittel leaves them
with the Ganoids, where Agassiz early placed them, but they
show little homology in structure with the true Ganoids. Some
have regarded them as aberrant Teleosts, possibly as freakish
catfishes. Cope saw in them a huge mailed group of archaic
Tunicates, while Patten has soberly and with considerable
plausibility urged their affinity<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> to the group of spiders, especially
to the horseshoe-crabs (<i>Limulus</i>) and their pal&aelig;ozoic
ancestors, the <i>Eurypterid&aelig;</i> and <i>Merostomata</i>.</p>

<p>The best guess as to the affinities of the Ostracophores is
perhaps that given by Dr. Ramsey H. Traquair ("Fossil Fishes
of the Silurian Rocks of the South of Scotland," 1899). Traquair
regards them as highly aberrant sharks, or, more exactly,
as being derived, like the Chim&aelig;ras, from a primitive Elasmobranch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>stock. In favor of this view is the character of their
armature, the bony plates themselves to be regarded as formed
by the fusion of shagreen grains or scales. According to Traquair:
"Specialization from the most specialized form, <i>Lanarkia</i>,
has been accompanied by (1) fusion of the spinelets (<i>Lanarkia</i>)
or shagreen grains (<i>Thelodus</i>) into plates, scutes, and
rhombic scales, supported by hard matter developed in a deeper
layer of skin, and (2) alterations in the pectoral fin-flaps, which,
becoming covered up by the postero-lateral plates in <i>Drepanaspis</i>,
are finally no longer recognizable in the <i>Pteraspid&aelig;</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>Woodward leaves their exact relationship undefined, while
others have regarded them as mailed lampreys, at any rate to
be excluded from the <i>Gnathostomi</i>, or jaw-bearing series. The
apparent absence of true jaws, true limbs, and limb-girdles
certainly seems to separate them widely from true fishes, but
these characters are negative only, perhaps due to degeneration,
and at any rate they are not yet absolutely determined. Certainly
they offer no positive proof of affinity with the modern
Cyclostomes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Traquair regards the <i>Heterostraci</i> or most primitive
<i>Ostracophores</i> as most certainly derived from the Elasmobranchs.
Other writers have attacked the integrity of the
group of Ostracophores, questioning the mutual relationship
of its component parts. Reiss, for example, regards the association
of the <i>Osteostraci</i> with the <i>Heterostraci</i> as "unbegr&uuml;ndet"
and "unheilvoll," while Ray Lankester, as quoted by Traquair,
affirms that "there is absolutely no reason for regarding <i>Cephalaspis</i>
as allied to <i>Pteraspis</i> beyond that the two genera occur
in the same rocks, and still less for concluding that either has
any connection with <i>Pterichthys</i>." Elsewhere Lankester states
that the <i>Heterostraci</i> are associated at present with the <i>Osteostraci</i>,
"because they have, like <i>Cephalaspis</i>, a large head-shield,
and because there is nothing else with which to associate them."
Patten, on the other hand, seems inclined to deny the rank
of <i>Heterostraci</i> and <i>Osteostraci</i> as even separate orders, regarding
them as very closely related to each other as also to their supposed
spider-like ancestors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 355.</span>&mdash;Head of <i>Odontotodus schrencki</i> Pander, from the side. (After Patten.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>But the consensus of opinion favors the belief that the
four orders usually included under this head are distinct and
at the same time are really related one to another. For our
purposes, then, we may regard the <i>Ostracophori</i> as a distinct
class of vertebrates. By placing it after the Elasmobranchs
we may indicate its probable descent from a primitive shark-like
stock.</p>

as related to the Spiders.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On this subject Dr. Dean remarks: "The entire problem
of the homology of the dermal plates and 'scales' in the Ostracophores
and Arthrognaths is to the writer by no means as
clear as previous writers have conceded. From the histological
standpoint, admitting the craniote nature of the vasodentine
and cancellous layers in the dermal plates, it nevertheless
does not follow that they have been derived from the
actual conditions of the dermal denticles of the ancestral Gnathostome,
as were unquestionably the dermal plates of Teleostomes
and Dipnoans. It seems equally if not more probable, on
the other hand, that the dermal armoring of the distinct groups
may have had an altogether different mode of origin, the product
of a crude evolution which aimed to strengthen the skin by a
general deposition of calcareous matter throughout its entire
thickness. The tuberculation of plates thus acquired might
have become an important step in the development of a more
superficial type of armoring which is most preferably represented
by the dermal denticles of Selachians. Nor, in passing, need
the presence of a mucus-canal system in the early plated forms
be of greater morphological importance than a foreshadowing
of the conditions of Gnathostomes, for this system of organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
might serve as well as evidence, in a general way, of relationship
with Marsipobranchs. Nor is this evidence the more conclusive
when we reflect that <i>no known type of Gnathostome, recent
or fossil, possesses open sensory grooves in distinct dermal plates</i>.
The presence, furthermore, of a dorsal fin and a 'truly piscine
heterocercal tail,' as noted by Traquair, is by no means as
Gnathostome-like as these structures at first glimpse appear.
For they lack not merely the characteristic radial supports of
fishes, but even actinotrichia. Their mode of support, on the
other hand, as Smith Woodward points out, is of a more generalized
nature, bent scales, homologous with those of the adjacent
body region, taking the place of the piscine external supports."
The actual position in the system to be finally assigned
to the Ostracophores is therefore still uncertain.</p>

<p><b>Orders of Ostracophores.</b>&mdash;Four orders of <i>Ostracophori</i> are
now usually recognized, known in the systems of Woodward and
Traquair as <i>Heterostraci</i>, <i>Osteostraci</i>, <i>Antiarcha</i>, and <i>Anaspida</i>.
The former is the most primitive and perhaps the most nearly
allied to the sharks, the second is not very remote from it, the
last two aberrant in very different directions. Hay places
the <i>Antiarcha</i> with the <i>Arthrodira</i> under the superorder of
<i>Placodermi</i>.</p>

<p><b>Order Heterostraci.</b>&mdash;The <i>Heterostraci</i> (&#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;], different; &#8000;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#8049;&#954;&#959;&#962;,
box) have no bone-corpuscles in the coat of mail. This
typically consists of a few pieces above, firmly united and
traversed by dermal sense-organs or "lateral lines." The
ventral shield is simple. Four families are recognized by
Traquair as constituting the <i>Heterostraci</i>, these forming a continuous
series from shark-like forms to the carapace-covered
<i>Pteraspis</i>. In the most primitive family, the <i>Thelodontid&aelig;</i>,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
the head and trunk are covered with small scales or tubercles
of dentine and not fused into large plates. The tail is slender
and heterocercal, the caudal fin deeply forked. Until lately
these tubercles were regarded as belonging to sharks, and they
are still regarded by Traquair as evidence of the affinity of
the <i>Heterostraci</i> with the <i>Acanthodei</i>. Dr. Traquair thinks
that a flap or lappet-like projection behind the head may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>a pectoral fin. The three known genera are <i>Thelodus</i>, <i>Lanarkia</i>,
and <i>Ateleaspis</i>. In <i>Thelodus</i> the scales consist of a base and
a crown separated by a constriction or neck. <i>Thelodus scoticus</i>,
<i>Thelodus pagei</i>, and <i>Thelodus planus</i> are found in the Silurian
rocks of Scotland. Other species, as <i>Thelodus tulensis</i> of Russia,
extend to the Upper Devonian.</p>

<p>In <i>Lanarkia</i> the large sharp scales have an expanded base
like the mouth of a trumpet. <i>Lanarkia horrida</i> and <i>L. spinulosa</i>
are found in the shire of Lanark in Scotland. In <i>Ateleaspis</i>
(<i>tesselatus</i>) the skin is covered with small polygonal plates. The
lateral flaps or possibly fins take the form of flat rhombic sculptured
scales. In this genus the eyes seem to be on the top of
the head.</p>

(After Traquair.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the <i>Psammosteid&aelig;</i> of the Devonian the head is covered
with large plates which are not penetrated by the sense-organs.
These plates are covered with minute, close-set tubercles,
covered with brilliant ganoid enamel and with finely crimped
edges. According to Dr. Traquair, these tubercles are shagreen
granules which have coalesced and become united to plates
formed in a deeper layer of the skin, as in <i>Ateleaspis</i> the minute
scales have run together into polygonal plates. These creatures
have been considered as "armored sharks," and Dr.
Traquair regards them as really related to the acanthodean
sharks. Nevertheless they are not really sharks at all, and
they find their place with the <i>Pteraspis</i> and other longer known
Heterostracans.</p>

<p>The family of <i>Drepanaspid&aelig;</i> consists of a single recently known
species, <i>Drepanaspis gmundenensis</i>, found in a pyritized condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
in purple roofing-slate in Gm&uuml;nden, Germany. This fish, which
reaches a length of about two feet, has a broad head, with eyes
on its outer margin, with a slender body and heterocercal tail.
The head has a broad median plate and smaller polygonal
ones. The flaps, supposed to represent the pectoral fins, are
here cased in immovable bone. No trace of internal skeleton is
found by Traquair, who has given the restoration of this species,
but the mouth has been outlined.</p>

</div>

<p>The best known of the Heterostracan families is that of
<i>Pteraspid&aelig;</i>. In this family the plates of the head are coalesced
in a large carpace, the upper part originally formed of seven
coalesced pieces. A stout dorsal spine fits into a notch of the
carapace. The slender body is covered with small scales and
ends in a heterocercal tail. The dermal sense-organs are well
developed. <i>Pteraspis rostrata</i> occurs in the Lower Devonian.
Other genera are <i>Pal&aelig;aspis</i> and <i>Cyrthaspis</i>.</p>

<p><b>Order Osteostraci.</b>&mdash;The Osteostraci (&#8004;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#959;&#957;, bone; &#959;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#962;,

the shields, and the shield of the back is in one piece without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
lateral-line channels or sense-organs. Ventral shield single. The
order includes three families. The <i>Cephalaspid&aelig;</i> have the shields
tuberculate, the one between the eyes fixed, and the anterior
body-shields are not fused into a continuous plate. The best
known of the numerous species is <i>Cephalaspis lyelli</i> from the
Lower Devonian of England. <i>Hemicyclaspis
murchisoni</i> occurs in the Upper
Silurian of England, and the extraordinary
<i>Cephalaspis dawsoni</i> in the
Lower Devonian of Gasp&eacute;, Canada.
<i>Eukeraspis pustulifera</i> has the head-shield
very slender and armed with
prickles. In the <i>Thyestid&aelig;</i> the anterior
body-scales are fused into a continuous
plate. <i>Thyestis</i> and <i>Didymaspis</i> are
genera of this type. The <i>Odontotodontid&aelig;</i>
(<i>Tremataspid&aelig;</i>) have the shield
truncate behind, its surface finely
punctate, and the piece between the
eyes not fixed. <i>Odontotodus<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> schrenki</i>

<p><b>Order Antiarcha.</b>&mdash;The Antiarcha (&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#8055;, opposite;  &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8057;&#962;,
anus) have also bone-corpuscles in the plates, which are also
enameled. The sense-organs occupy open grooves, and the dorsal
and ventral shields are of many pieces. The head is jointed
on the trunk, and jointed to the head are paddle-like appendages,
covered with bony plates and resembling limbs. There is no
evidence that these erectile plates are real limbs. They seem
to be rather jointed appendages of the head-plate, erectile on
a hinge like a pectoral spine. There are traces of ear-cavities,
gill-arches, and other fish-like structures, but nothing suggestive
of mouth or limbs.</p>

<p>This group contains one family, the <i>Asterolepid&aelig;</i>, with numerous
species, mostly from Devonian rocks. The best known
genus is <i>Pterichthyodes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> in which the anterior median plate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>of the back is overlapped by the posterior dorso-lateral. <i>Pterichthyodes
milleri</i> from the Lower Devonian, named by Agassiz
for Hugh Miller, is the best known species, although numerous
others, mostly from Scottish quarries, are in the British
Museum. <i>Asterolepis maximus</i> is a very large species from
the same region, known from a single plate. <i>Bothriolepis
canadensis</i> is from the Upper Devonian of Scaumenac Bay near
Quebec, numerous specimens and fragments finely preserved
having been found.</p>

than the rocks called Silurian, although fishes in numbers are
not elsewhere known from rocks earlier than the Ludlow shales
of the Upper Silurian, corresponding nearly to the Niagara

<p><b>Order Anaspida.</b>&mdash;Recently a fourth order, <i>Anaspida</i> (&#7940;,
without; &#7936;&#963;&#960;&#8055;&#962;, shield), has been added to the <i>Ostracophori</i>
through the researches of Dr. Traquair. This group occurs
in the Upper Silurian in the south of Scotland. It includes
the single family <i>Birkeniid&aelig;</i>, characterized by the fusiform
body, bluntly rounded head, bilobate, heterocercal tail, and a
median row of hooked spinous scales along the ventral margin.
No trace of jaws, teeth, limbs, or internal skeleton has been
found. Unlike other Ostracophores, <i>Birkenia</i> has no cranial
buckler with orbits on the top, nor have the scales and tubercles
the microscopic structure found in other Ostracophores. In
the genus <i>Birkenia</i> the head and body are completely covered
by tubercular scutes. The gill-openings seem to be represented
by a series of small perforations on the sides. A dorsal fin is
present. <i>Birkenia elegans</i> is from the Ludlow and Downstonian
rocks of southern Scotland. <i>Lasianius problematicus</i> from the
same rocks is very similar, but is scaleless. It has a row of
ventral plates like those of <i>Birkenia</i>, the only other hard parts it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
possesses being a number of parallel rods behind the head,
homologous with the lateral series of <i>Birkenia</i>. <i>Lasianius</i> is
therefore a specialized and degenerate representation of <i>Birkenia</i>,
differing somewhat as "the nearly naked <i>Phanerosteon</i>
differs from other <i>Pal&aelig;oniscid&aelig;</i> whose bodies are covered with
osseous scales."</p>

for the group of bony trunkfishes, <i>Ostracid&aelig;</i>. The still earlier name of
<i>Placodermi</i>, chosen by McCoy (1848), was intended to include Arthrodires as
well as Ostracophores. Rohon (1892) calls the group <i>Protocephali</i>, and to
the two orders he assigns the names <i>Aspidorhini</i> and <i>Aspidocephali</i>. These
groups correspond to <i>Heterostraci</i> and <i>Osteostraci</i> of Woodward. Another
name of early date is that of <i>Aspidoganoidei</i>, given by Professor Gill in 1876,
but not defined until 1896. These fishes are, however, not "Ganoids" and
the name <i>Ostracophori</i> seems to receive general preference. The group <i>Peltacephalata</i>
of Patten corresponds essentially to <i>Ostracophori</i>, as does also the
order <i>Hypostomata</i> of Gadow.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_153_153" id="Footnote_153_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153_153"><span class="label">[153]</span></a> According to Professor Patten's view, the close resemblance of the shields
of <i>Pteraspis</i> to those of contemporaneous <i>Eurypterids</i> indicates real affinity.
But the <i>Eurypterids</i> are related to the spiders and to <i>Limulus</i>. The only
reason for thinking that <i>Pteraspis</i> is a fish at all lies in its resemblance to
<i>Cephalaspis</i>, which is in several ways fish-like, although its head shield is
much like that of <i>Limulus</i>. All these resemblances in Patten's view indicate
real affinity. Patten considers the <i>Pteraspids</i> as derived from primitive
arachnid or spider-like forms having a bony carapace as <i>Limulus</i> has. From
<i>Pteraspis</i> he derives the other Ostracophores, and from these the sharks and
other vertebrates, all of which appear later in time than the earliest Ostracophores.
This view of the origin of vertebrates is recently urged with much
force by Professor Patten (Amer. Nat., 1904, 1827). Most naturalists regard
such resemblances in specialized structures on the outside of an animal as
parallelisms due to likeness in conditions of life. The external structure in
forms of really different nature is often similarly modified. Thus certain
catfishes, pipefishes, sea-moths, and agonoid fishes are all provided with bony
plates not unlike those of ganoid fishes, although indicative of no real affinity
with them. Commonly the ancestry of vertebrates is traced through enteropneustans
to soft-bodied worms which have left no trace in the rocks.
</p>
<p>
In the same connection, Professor Patten suggests that the lateral fold
from which many writers have supposed that the limbs or paired fins of vertebrates
is evolved is itself a resultant of the fusion of the fringing appendages
on the sides of the body. Such appendages are found in the primitive mailed
arachnoids and in <i>Limulus</i>. They are shown very plainly in Patten's restoration
of <i>Cephalaspis</i>. About thirty of them of a bony nature and jointed to
the body occur on either side between the gill opening and the vent.</p></div>

ARTHRODIRES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_581.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Arthrodires.</b>&mdash;Another large group of extinct fishes
mailed and helmeted is included under the general
name of <i>Arthrodira</i><a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> (&#7940;&#961;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#962;, joint; &#948;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;, neck), or
<i>Arthrognathi</i> (&#7940;&#961;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#962;, &#947;&#957;&#8049;&#952;&#959;&#962;, jaw), the latter term recently framed
by Dr. Dean with a somewhat broader application than the
former.</p>

<p>These fishes differ from the Ostracophores, on the one hand,
in the possession of jaws and in the nature of their armored
covering. On the other hand, the nature of these jaws, the
lack of differentiation of the skeleton, and the uncertain character
of the limbs separate them still more widely from the true
fishes. Their place in the system is still unknown, but their
origin seems as likely to be traceable to Ostracophores as to
any other group.</p>

<p>The head in all the species is covered with a great bony
helmet. Behind this on the nape is another large shield, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>between the two is usually a huge joint which Dr. Dean compares
to the hinge of a spring-beetle (<i>Elater</i>).</p>

<p>As to the presence of limbs, no trace of pectoral fin or anterior
limb has been found. Dean denies the existence of any structures
corresponding to either limb, but Woodward figures a
supposititious posterior limb in <i>Coccosteus</i>, finding traces of basal
bones which may belong to it.</p>

<p>These monstrous creatures have been considered by Woodward
and others as mailed Dipnoans, but their singular jaws
are quite unlike those of the <i>Dipneusti</i>, and very remote from
any structures seen in the ordinary fish. The turtle-like mandibles
seem to be formed of dermal elements, in which there lies
little homology to the jaws of a fish and not much more with the
jaws of Dipnoan or shark.</p>

<p>The relations with the Ostracophores are certainly remote,
though nothing else seems to be any nearer. They have no
affinity with the true Ganoids, to which vaguely limited group
many writers have attached them. Nor is there any sure
foundation to the view adopted by Woodward, that they are
to be considered as armored offshoots of the Dipnoans.</p>

<p>According to Dean we might as well refer the Arthrodires
to the sharks as to the Dipnoans. Dean further observes
("Fishes Living and Fossil"):</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_582.jpg" width="700" height="188" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 366.</span>&mdash;<i>Coccosteus cuspidatus</i> Agassiz, restored. Lower Devonian. (After
Traquair, per Woodward.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The puzzling characters of the Arthrodirans do not seem
to be lessened by a more definite knowledge of their different
forms. The tendency, as already noted, seems to be at present
to regard the group provisionally as a widely modified offshoot
of the primitive Dipnoans, basing this view upon their general
structural characters, dermal plates, dentition, autostylism.
But only in the latter regard could they have differed more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
widely from the primitive Elasmobranch or Teleostome, if it
be admitted that in the matter of dermal structures they may
be clearly separated from the Chim&aelig;roid. It certainly is
difficult to believe that the articulation of the head of Arthrodirans
could have been evolved after dermal bones had come
to be formed, or that a Dipnoan could become so metamorphosed
as to lose not only its body
armoring, but its pectoral appendages
as well. The size of the
pectoral girdle is, of course, little
proof that an anterior pair of
fins must have existed, since this
may well have been evolved in
relation to the muscular supports of plastron, carapace, trunk,
and head. The intermovement of the dental plates, seen especially
in <i>Dinichthys</i>, is a further difficulty in accepting their
direct descent from the Dipnoans."</p>

</div>

<p><b>Occurrence of Arthrodires.</b>&mdash;These fishes occur in abundance
from the Silurian times to the Mesozoic. In the Devonian their
gigantic size and thick armor gave them the leading position
among the hosts of the sea. Among the genera there occurred
"series of forms most interesting as to their evolution." "It is
found more and more evident," says Dr. Dean ("Fishes, Living
and Fossil," pp. 135, 136) "that the Arthrodirans may have represented
the dominant group in the Devonian period, as were
the sharks in the Carboniferous, or as are the Teleosts in modern
times. There were forms which, like <i>Coccosteus</i>, had eyes
at the notches of the head-buckler; others, like <i>Macropetalichthys</i>,
in which orbits were well centralized; some, like <i>Dinichthys</i>
and <i>Titanichthys</i>, with the pineal foramen present; some with
pectoral spines(?); some with elaborately sculptured dermal
plates. Among their forms appear to have been those whose
shape was apparently subcylindrical, adapted for swift swimming;
others (<i>Mylostoma</i>) whose trunk was depressed to almost
ray-like proportions. In size they varied from that of the perch
to that of a basking shark. In dentition they presented the
widest range in variation, from the formidable shear-like jaws
of <i>Dinichthys</i> to the lip-like mandibles of <i>Titanichthys</i>, the
tearing teeth of <i>Trachosteus</i>, the wonderfully forked tooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>-bearing
jaw-tips of <i>Diplognathus</i>, to the Cestraciont type, <i>Mylostoma</i>.
The latter form has hitherto been known only from its
dentition, but now proves to be, as Newberry and Smith Woodward
suggested, a typical Arthrodiran."</p>

<p><b>Classification of Arthrodira.</b>&mdash;Our knowledge of the systematic
relations of the Arthrodira is mostly of recent origin.
Woodward refers most of the remains to the best known genus
<i>Coccosteus</i>, and recognizes as families the <i>Coccosteid&aelig;</i>, <i>Mylostomid&aelig;</i>,
<i>Asterosteid&aelig;</i>, and <i>Phyllolepid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 368.</span>&mdash;An Arthrodire, <i>Dinichthys intermedius</i> Newberry, restored. Devonian,
Ohio. (After Dean.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Bashford Dean in different papers has treated these
fishes in great detail. In a recent paper on the "Relationships
of the <i>Arthrognathi</i>"<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> he recognizes the group as a class coordinate
with <i>Cyclostomi</i> and <i>Elasmobranchii</i>. This class, which
he calls <i>Arthrognathi</i>, is first divided into two suborders, <i>Anarthrodira</i>,
without joint at the neck, and <i>Arthrodira</i>, with such
a joint. The former comprises one order, <i>Stegothalami</i>, and the
latter two orders, <i>Temnothoraci</i> and <i>Arthrothoraci</i>. The following
is Dr. Dean's definition of these orders and their component
families:</p>

<p><b>Arthrognathi.</b>&mdash;"Chordates whose anterior body region is
encased in dermal elements, and divisible by a more or less
definite partition into head and trunk. Dermal plates which
surround the mouth function as jaws. No evidence of branchial
arches. Column notochordal, showing no traces of centra; well-marked
neural and h&aelig;mal elements. Paired limbs [absent or
uncertain]. Dermal plates consisting typically of two layers,
the superficial tuberculate, the inner bony with radiating lamell&aelig;.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>Orbits situated near or at the margin of the head-shield
and separated from one another by fixed integumental plates.
A pineal funnel present situated in a fixed plate. A mucous
system whose canals radiate from the preoccipital region."</p>

<p><b>Anarthrodira.</b>&mdash;"Arthrognaths in which the cranial and
dorsal regions are separated by a fixed partition whose dorsal
rim is overlapped and concealed by superficial plates. Of these
a large median dorsal element is present which extends backward
superficially from the region near the pineal funnel. Also
a pair of elements which overlie the position of the external
occipital joint. Suborbital plates apparently absent. Jaw
elements undescribed."</p>

<p><b>Stegothalami</b> (&#963;&#964;&#8051;&#947;&#959;&#962;, roof; &#952;&#8049;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962;, chamber).&mdash;"Anarthrodires
in which the cranio-dorsal septum is vertical and deep,
its height equal apparently to that of the arch of the head-shield.
By this deep partition the latter appears to inclose two
chambers (whence the ordinal name). Orbits inclosed by pre- and
postorbital plates. Mucous system lacks a postorbital
canal."</p>

<p>One family, the <i>Macropetalichthyid&aelig;</i>, thus defined:</p>

<p>"Stegothalami with large orbits and well-arched cranio-dorsal
shield. Dorso-central shield long, wide, gomphoidal,
extending backward to the hinder margin of the shield and
bordered by all plates save the postorbitals and marginals.
Pineal funnel small and obscure." <i>Macropetalichthys sullivanti</i>
from Ohio Devonian rocks, and <i>Macropetalichthys agassizi</i> from
the Devonian of Germany, are important species of this
group.</p>

<p>The <i>Asterosteid&aelig;</i> perhaps constitute a second family in
this order. The single species <i>Asterosteus stenocephalus</i> is from
the Devonian of Ohio.</p>

<p><b>Arthrodira.</b>&mdash;"Arthrognaths in which the dorsal armoring
is separated into dorsal and cranial elements, the latter attached
to the former movably by means of a pair of peg-and-socket
joints. The interval lying between cranial and dorsal armoring
does not appear to have been protected by plates, and in
the median line, instead of the cranio-central of the Anarthrodires,
there are separate elements, median occipital, median dorsal,
and perhaps others. Suborbital plates present. Jaws of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
pairs of elements. Ventral armoring of two pairs of lateral
and two median elements."</p>

<p><b>Temnothoraci</b> (&#964;&#8051;&#956;&#957;&#969;, to cut; &#952;&#8061;&#961;&#945;&#958;, thorax).&mdash;"Arthrodires
whose cranial and dorsal shields are closely apposed, separated
only by a transverse fissure-like interval (whence the ordinal
name); interarticulation of cranial and dorsal shields little
developed. Head-shield elliptical in outline as far as the line of
the transverse division. The anterior rim of the shoulder-shield
flattened at its sides, suggesting a rudiment of the vertical
partition of the Anarthrodira. Suborbital plate is present,
but takes no part, apparently, in the ventral boundary of the
orbit, this being formed, as in the Anarthrodira, by the pre- and
postorbital elements. Jaws, ventral armoring, and endoskeleton
not definitely known."</p>

<p>One family, <i>Chelonichthyid&aelig;</i>, thus defined:</p>

<p>"Temnothoraci with orbits relatively small in size and
situated well forward in the head-shield. Occipital elements
produced antero-posteriorly, the external occipital forming the
posterior lateral angle of the head, no projection of the head
occurring in the region of the marginal plate. Median occipital
trapezoidal. Centrals take part in the median boundary of the
orbits, and embrace the pineal plate. Median dorsal with
poorly developed keel and terminal process."</p>

<p><i>Heterosteus asmussi</i> (perhaps to be called <i>Ichthyosauroides
spinosus</i>) is a gigantic species from the Lower Devonian of
Livonia.</p>

<p>Allied to this species is <i>Homostius milleri</i> from Scotland,
celebrated as the "Asterolepis of Stromness" in Hugh Miller's
"Footsteps of the Creator." Another notable species is <i>Homostius
formosissimus</i> from the Lower Devonian of Russia.</p>

<p><b>Arthrothoraci.</b>&mdash;"Arthrodires whose dorsal shield articulates
with the head-roof by a conspicuous and movable peg-and-socket
joint, and leaves a definite interval (unprotected?)
between the two armorings. Orbits marginal, bounded inferiorly
not by the suborbital element. In the head-shield the
postero-lateral angles formed by the marginal plate (<i>Phlyct&aelig;naspis?</i>),
the occipital border concave. A dorsal fin is present,
supported by endoskeletal elements." Five families, the most
important being the <i>Coccosteid&aelig;</i>, thus defined:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span></p>

<p>"Arthrothoraci with head-shield hexagonal in outline.
Median occipital trapezoidal, margins underlapped conspicuously
by the external occipitals. Prefrontals meet below pineal
plates, thus occluding this element from contact with centrals.
The median dorsal plate elongated, terminating in an acute heavy
point; no definite ventral keel; its anterior border approaches
the head-shield more closely than in related families. Cranio-dorsal
joint relatively small. Postero-dorso-lateral large." (?A
pair of spines occurs in the pectoral region.) The best-known
species is <i>Coccosteus cuspidatus</i> (<i>decipiens</i>) of the Lower Red
Sandstone or Devonian of Scotland.</p>

<p>The family of <i>Dinichthyid&aelig;</i> consists of "Arthrothoraci with
stout trenchant jaws, whose cutting surfaces have worn away
marginal teeth. Plates heavy. Head-shield with conspicuous
lateral indentation to form dorsal border of orbit. Preorbitals
separated by rostral and pineal elements, the latter passing
backward between the anterior ends of the centrals. Cranio-dorsal
joint conspicuous. Median dorsal shovel-shaped, nearing
a stout keel with a large neck and with heavy gouge-shaped
terminal. Postero-dorso-lateral relatively small in size." <i>Dinichthys
hertzeri</i> and numerous other species are described from
the Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of Ohio.</p>

<p>The <i>Titanichthyid&aelig;</i> are "Arthrothoraci with slender edentulous
jaws bearing a longitudinal sulcus. Plates squamous.
Head-shield wide, with indentations to form dorsal border of
orbit. Cranio-dorsal joint complete, but of relatively small size.
Median dorsal with lateral border indented with rudimentary
keel and with flat and rounded terminal. Antero-dorso-lateral
with an area of overlap on median border." <i>Titanichthys agassizi</i>
is a gigantic mailed fish from the Lower Carboniferous of
Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

<p>The <i>Mylostomid&aelig;</i> are "Arthrothoraci with dental elements in
the character of crushing plates. Cranial shield wide, rounded
anteriorly, deeply indented in nuchal margin; orbital rim not
apparent in dorsal aspect. Central separated from marginal."
<i>Mylostoma terrelli</i> is based on jaws from Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

<p>The <i>Selenosteid&aelig;</i> are "Arthrothoraci with jaws studded with
cuspidate teeth; the mandibular rami rounding out anteriorly or
presenting diverging tips, bearing teeth in the symphysis. Cranial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
shield deeply concave on lateral margins, no orbital rim here apparent.
Nuchal border deeply indented. (Centrals separate from
marginals.) Cranio-dorsal hinges large in size. Dorsal armoring
reduced antero-posteriorly, giving an almost zone-like appearance.
Dorso-median crescent-shaped, with feeble keel and
knob." <i>Selenosteus glaber</i> is described by Dean from the Cleveland
shales.</p>

<p><b>Relations of Arthrodires.</b>&mdash;To complete our account of the
Arthrodira we may here summarize Dr. Dean's reasons for separating
its members from true fishes on the one hand and from the
Ostracophores on the other.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">First.</span> The Arthrodira cannot be strictly included among
the Pisces. According to the definition of the latter class its
members are Craniotes possessing the following characters:
<i>a</i>, dermal defenses which in their simplest terms can be reduced
to the shagreen denticles of the Elasmobranch; <i>b</i>, a
series of definite gill-arches whose foremost elements are metamorphosed
into hyoid and mandibular apparatus; <i>c</i>, paired
fins, or their equivalents. In the first of these regards I think
it can be shown that the remarkable character of the dermal
plates in the Arthrognaths approaches rather that of the Ostracophores
than that of the Pisces. In certain of these forms,
<i>Trachosteus</i>, for example, the tuberculated plates are made up
of inner and outer elements, each with tubercles, which denote
a distinctly different mode of origin from that of any known
type of fish. The absence of remains of gill-arches in the Arthrognaths
would be not a serious objection to including these
forms among Pisces, especially in view of the fact that cartilaginous
gill-arches are rarely preserved even in favorable
fossils. But that their presence is more than doubtful is indicated
by the peculiar character of the 'jaws' in these forms.
For the character of these structures is such as to suggest that
they are not homologous with the branchial arch jaws of the
true fishes, but are rather parallel structures which owe their
origin to distinctly exoskeletal elements, i.e., that they were
derived from dermal plates surrounding the mouth, which became
mobile, and whose edges became apposed as sectorial
structures. I would in this connection call attention to the
fact that the 'mandibles,' 'premaxillary,' and 'maxillary'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
dental plates<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> were not fixed in the sense in which these elements
are in the true Pisces. On the evidence of several types,
<i>Dinichthys</i>, <i>Titanichthys</i>, <i>Mylostoma</i>, <i>Trachosteus</i>, <i>Diplognathus</i>,
and other of the American forms, <i>Macropetalichthys</i><a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> excepted,
there is the clearest proof that each element of the jaws had a
considerable amount of independent movement. On account
of the mobility of these elements the name Arthrognathi is
suggested. Thus the mandibular rami could change the angle
of inclination towards each other, as well as their plane with
reference to the vertical axis. So, too, could the 'premaxill&aelig;'
be protracted like a pair of bent fingers, and it is more than
probable that the 'maxill&aelig;' had a considerable amount of independent
movement. In connection with these characters it is
also important to note that the blades of the 'mandible' show
nowhere the faintest trace of an articular facet for attachment
to the cranium. In short, the entire plan of the mandibular
apparatus in these forms is strikingly unfish-like, although
one will frankly confess that it is remarkable that these forms
should have paralleled so strikingly the piscine conditions, to
the extent of producing mandibular rami margined with teeth,
and an arrangement of toothed elements on the 'upper jaw'
which resembles superficially the premaxillary and maxillary
structures of teleostomes, or the vomero-palatine structures
of lung-fishes and chim&aelig;ras.</p>

<p>"In the matter of paired fins there seems little evidence to
conclude that either pectoral or pelvic fins were present. In
spite of the researches upon these forms during the past half-century,
no definite remains of pectoral fins have been described.
The so-called pectoral spines described for <i>Dinichthys</i>
by Newberry, whatever they may be, certainly are not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>as far as the present evidence goes, pterygial, nor are the similar
structures in <i>Brachydirus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The sigmoid element, described
as a 'pelvic girdle' by Smith Woodward, in Coccosteus, a structure
which appears to occur in a small species of <i>Dinichthys</i>(?),
may as reasonably be interpreted as a displaced element of
the armor-plates of the trunk. In <i>Coccosteus</i>, as far as I am
aware, it occurs in well-preserved condition in but a single
specimen.</p>

<p>"In referring to the singular joint between the shoulder-plates
and the hinder margin of the cranium Smith Woodward
has called attention to one of the striking features of the group.
It is one, however, which, as a functional structure, i.e., a joint,
characterizes only a portion of its members; and in these the
region in which vestiges of the joint are sought is overlaid and
concealed by dermal plates. Such are the conditions in <i>Macropetalichthys</i>
(with transitional characters in <i>Trachosteus</i> and in
<i>Mylostoma</i>). For this form a special subclass (or order) may
be created which we may term Anarthrodira.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Second.</span> The <i>Arthrognathi</i> cannot well be included in any
other class. It would certainly be more convenient to retain
the Arthrognaths among the Ostracophores, regarding them
as a fourth subclass, were it not that they differ from them in
so marked a way in the presence of well-marked vertebral arches,
of supports for the unpaired fin, and in the possession of 'jaws.'
In these regards&mdash;add to them the (probable if not certain)
absence of the paired paddle-like 'spines'&mdash;they stand certainly
further from the Antiarcha than these from the Osteostraci,
or than the latter from the Heterostraci. It appears to me
desirable, therefore, that the Arthrodira and the Anarthrodira
be brought together as a separate class. Should subsequent
researches demonstrate a closer affinity with the Ostracophores,
the Arthrognathi can be regarded as of rank as a subclass, with
the orders Anarthrodira and Arthrodira."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span></p>

<p>In a recent paper Dr. Otto Jaekel unites
Arthrodires and Ostracophores under the name
<i>Placodermi</i>. He regards <i>Pteraspis</i> as a larval
type, <i>Asterolepis</i> as one more specialized. In
<i>Coccosteus</i> he claims to find a pelvic girdle as
well as a more segmented skeleton. He regards
all of these as true fishes, the <i>Coccosteid&aelig;</i> as
ancestral, related on the one hand to the <i>Crossopterygians</i>,
and on the other to the <i>Stegocephali</i>
and other ancestral Amphibians.</p>

<p><b>Suborder Cycli&aelig;.</b>&mdash;We may append to the <i>Arthrodira</i>
as a possible suborder the group called <i>Cycli&aelig;</i>
by Dr. Gill, based on a single imperfectly known
species. Few organisms discovered in recent times
have excited as much interest as this minute fish-like
creature, called <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus gunni</i>, discovered
in 1890 by Dr. R. H. Traquair in the
flagstones of Caithness in Scotland. Many specimens
have been obtained, none more than an inch
and a half long. Its structure and systematic
position have been discussed by Dr. R. H. Traquair,
by Woodward, Gill, Gegenbaur, and recently by
Dean, from whose valuable memoir on "The Devonian
Lamprey" we make several quotations.</p>

Devonian. (After Traquair and
Dean.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Pal&aelig;ospondylus.</b>&mdash;According to Dr. Traquair: "The
<i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus gunni</i> is a very small organism, usually
under one inch in length, though exceptionally
large specimens occasionally measure one inch
and a half.... It has a head and vertebral
column, but no trace of jaws or limbs;
and, strange to say, all the specimens
are seen only from the ventral aspect,
as is shown by the relation of the
neural arches to the vertebral
centra.</p>

<p>"The head is in most cases
much eroded.... It is divided
by a notch ... into
two parts.... The <i>anterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
part</i> shows a groove the edges of which are elevated, while the
surface on each side shows two depressions, like fenestr&aelig;, though
perhaps they are not completely perforated, and also a groove
partially divided off, posteriorly and externally, a small lobe.
In front there is a ring-like opening ... surrounded by small
pointed cirri, four ventrally, at least five dorsally, and two long
lateral ones which seem to arise inside the margin of the ring
instead of from its rim like the others. The <i>posterior part</i> of
the cranium is flattened, but the median groove is still observable.
Connected with the posterior or occipital aspect of
the skull are two small narrow plates which lie closely alongside
the first half-dozen vertebr&aelig;.</p>

<p>"The bodies of the vertebr&aelig; are hollow or ring-like, and
those immediately in front are separated from each other by
perceptible intervals; their surfaces are marked with a few
little longitudinal grooves, of which one is median. They are
provided with neural arches, which are at first short and quadrate,
but towards the caudal extremity lengthen out into slender
neural spines, which form the dorsal expansion of a caudal fin,
while shorter h&aelig;mal ones are also developed on the ventral
aspect."</p>

<p>Dr. Traquair concludes that "there seems to be no escape
from the conclusion that the little creature must be classed
as a Marsipobranch." "If <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> is not a Marsipobranch,
it is quite impossible to refer it to any other existing
group of vertebrates."</p>

<p><b>Gill on Pal&aelig;ospondylus.</b>&mdash;In 1896 Dr. Gill proposed to
regard <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> provisionally as the type of a distinct
order of Cyclostomes to be called <i>Cycli&aelig;</i> (&#954;&#8059;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962;, circle), from
the median ring on the head, whether nostril or mouth. Dr.
Gill observes:</p>

<p>"Assuming the correctness of Dr. Traquair's description and
figures, we certainly have a remarkable combination of characters.
On the one hand, if the 'median opening or rim' is
indeed nasal, the animal certainly cannot be referred to the
class of Selachians or of Teleostomes. On the other hand, the
cranium and the segmental vertebral column indicate a more
advanced stage of development of the vertebrate line than that
from the living Marsipobranchs must have originated. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
may, therefore, with propriety isolate it as the representative
not only of a peculiar family (<i>Pal&aelig;ospondylid&aelig;</i>), but of an order
or even subclass (Cycli&aelig;) of vertebrates which may provisionally
(and only provisionally) be retained in the class of Marsipobranchs.</p>

<p>"The group may be defined as Monorrhines with a continuous (?)
cranium, a median nasal (?) ring, and a segmented vertebral
column.</p>

<p>"The differences between the <i>Hyperoartia</i> and <i>Hyperotreta</i>
are very great, and Prof. Lankester did not go much too
far when he elevated those groups to class rank. Among
the numerous distinctive characters are the great differences
in the auditory organs. Perhaps the organs of <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i>
might be worked out in some specimen and throw light on the
subject of affinities. At present even the region of the auditory
organs is not exactly known and we are now at a loss to orient
the several parts of the cranium. In fact, the question of the
relations of <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> is a very open one."</p>

<p><b>Views as to the Relationships of Pal&aelig;ospondylus.</b>&mdash;Dr. Dean
thus summarizes in a convenient and interesting fashion the
views of different students of fossil fishes in regard to <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i>:</p>

<p><b>Huxley.</b>&mdash;A "baby <i>Coccosteus</i>."</p>

<p><b>Traquair, 1890.</b>&mdash;"Certainly not a Placoderm, its resemblance
to a supposed 'baby Coccosteus' being entirely deceptive.
The appearance of the head does remind us in a strange way
of the primitive skull of <i>Myxine</i>, a resemblance which is rendered
still more suggestive by the apparent complete absence
of the lower jaw, or of limbs or limb-girdles."</p>

<p><b>Traquair, 1893.</b>&mdash;"It seems, indeed, impossible to refer the
organism to any existing vertebrate class, unless it be the Marsipobranchs
or Cyclostomata." Does not believe it a larval
form, because the possible adult is unknown, and because of
the highly differentiated vertebr&aelig;. Granting his interpretation
of the parts of the fossil, "there seems no escape from the conclusion
that the little creature must be classed as a Marsipobranch."</p>

<p><b>Traquair, 1897.</b>&mdash;"The question of the affinities of <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i>
is left precisely where it was after I had written my
last paper on the subject."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Smith Woodward, 1892.</b>&mdash;"It seems to possess an unpaired
nose, lip cartilages in place of functional jaws, and no paired
limbs; thus agreeing precisely with the lampreys and hagfishes,
of which the fossil representatives have long been sought. It
is extremely probable, therefore, that <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> belongs
to this interesting category."</p>

<p><b>Dawson, 1893.</b>&mdash;<i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> suggests "the smaller snake-like
Batrachians of the Carboniferous and Permian; and I
should not be surprised if it should come to be regarded as
either a forerunner of the Batrachians or as a primitive tadpole."</p>

<p><b>Gill, 1896.</b>&mdash;"The group to which <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> belongs
may be defined as Monorrhines with a continuous (?) cranium,
a median nasal (?) ring, and a segmented vertebral column."
"The cranium and segmented vertebral column indicate a
more advanced stage of development of the vertebrate line
than that from which the living Marsipobranchs must have
originated. We may, therefore, with propriety isolate it as
the representative not only of a peculiar family (<i>Pal&aelig;ospondylid&aelig;</i>),
but of an order or even subclass (<i>Cycli&aelig;</i>) of vertebrates
which may provisionally (and only provisionally) be retained
in the class of Marsipobranchs."</p>

<p><b>Dean, 1896.</b>&mdash;"Place it with the Ostracoderms among the
curiously specialized offshoots of the early Chordates, but this
position would be at the best unsatisfactory."</p>

<p><b>Dean, 1898.</b>&mdash;"<i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> should not be given a place&mdash;even
a provisional one&mdash;among the Marsipobranchs." To be
accepted "as the representative of the new subclass (or class)
Cycli&aelig; constituted for it by Professor Gill."</p>

<p><b>Parker &amp; Haswell, 1897.</b>&mdash;"There is some reason to regard
that <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> is referable to the Cyclostomes." "A
distinctly higher type than recent forms."</p>

<p><b>Gegenbaur, 1898.</b>&mdash;"Discovery of <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> one of
the highest importance. If this organism stands in no way
near the Cyclostomes, the tentacles lose their higher importance,
since they also occur in other groups." "Through <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i>
came also the attempt (Pollard) to deduce the presence
of the tentacular condition in the higher forms." (<i>Mem.</i>&mdash;In this
Gegenbaur has not consulted the literature accurately. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
the time of founding his "Cirrhostomal Theory" Pollard was
unaware of the discovery of <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i>). "Ich muss
sagen, das die positive Behauptung der einen wie der anderen
Deutung mir sehr unsicher scheint, da auch an den &uuml;brigen
Resten des Kopfskelets keine bestimmten Uebereinstimmungen
mit anderen Organismen erweisbar sind. Es ist daher auch
nicht zu vermuthen, dass sogar an Beziehung zu Froschlarven
gedacht ward. Unter diesen Umst&auml;nden m&ouml;chte ich jene im
Verh&auml;ltniss zum Kopfe wie zum gesammten K&ouml;rper bedeutende,
von Cirren umstellte Eingangs&ouml;ffnung als nicht einer Nase,
sondern einem Munde oder beiden zugleich angeh&ouml;rig betrachten.
Zu einem dem Cyclostomenriechorgan vergleichbaren Verhalten
fehlen alle Bedingungen."</p>

<p><b>Relationships of Pal&aelig;ospondylus.</b>&mdash;The arguments for and
against the supposition that <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> is a Cyclostome
may be here summed up after Professor Dean.</p>

<p>The vertebral column agrees with that of the lamprey in
having the notochord in part persistent. On the other hand,
the vertebr&aelig; have continuous centra, showing definite processes.
Those of the different regions are differentiated. These conditions
are quite unlike those seen in the lamprey.</p>

<p>The cranium is massive, over twice as large proportionally
as that of the lamprey. In the latter type the cranium forms
but a small portion of the bulk of the head; in <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i>,
on the other hand, the cranium bears every sign of having
filled the contour of the head. Moreover, if the region adjacent
to the structure is admitted to be that of the eye,
and few, I believe, will doubt it, then the brain-cavity must,
by many analogies, have been much larger than that of a Marsipobranch.
Also the auditory capsules must have been of
extraordinary size. In short, there is very little about the
cranium to suggest the structures of Cyclostomes.</p>

<p>The "oral cirri" suggest somewhat the barbels of the nose
and mouth of a hagfish. They, however, resemble even as
much in arrangement and greater number the buccal cirri of
<i>Amphioxus</i>. On the other hand, similar mouth-surrounding
tentacles are evolved independently in many groups of fishes,
siluroids, sharks, forms like <i>Pogonias</i>, <i>Hemitripterus</i>. A possi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>bility
further exists that the "cirri" may turn out to be remnants
of cranial or facial structures of an entirely different nature.
In fact the very uncertain preservation of these parts renders
their evidence of little definite value. In but one specimen,
as far as I am aware, is there any evidence of the presence of
ventral cirri.</p>

<p>The jaw parts in <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> are unknown. It is possible
that the ventral rim of the "nasal ring" may prove to be
the remains of the Meckelian cartilage (the cartilaginous core
of the lower jaw).</p>

<p>It is possible that certain very faint ray-like markings noted
by Professor Dean may be the basalia of paired fins. In such
case <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> can have no affinity with the lampreys.
Dr. Dean asserts that the presence of these, in view of the wide
dissimilarity in other and important structures, is sufficient
to remove <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> from its provisional position among
the Cyclostomes. The postoccipital plates may represent
a pectoral arch. It is, however, much more likely, as Dr. Traquair
has insisted, that the supposed rays are due to the reflection
of light from striations on the stone, and that the creature had
no pectoral limbs.</p>

<p>The caudal fin, with its dichotomous rays, is essentially
like the tail of a lamprey. This condition is, however, found
in other groups of fishes, as among sharks and lung-fishes.
It is, moreover, doubtful whether the rays are really dichotomous.</p>

<p>It is possible that <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> may be, as Huxley suggests,
a larval Arthrodire. It is not probable that this is the
case, but, on the other hand, <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> seems to be an
immature form. According to Dr. Dean, it is more likely to
prove a larval <i>Coccosteus</i>, or the young of some other Arthrodire,
than a lamprey. Against this view must be urged the fact
that the tail of <i>Pal&aelig;ospondylus</i> is not heterocercal, a fact verified
by Dr. Traquair on all of his many specimens. It is more
like the tail of a lamprey than that of <i>Coccosteus</i>. It is, however,
certain that it cannot be placed in the same class with
the living <i>Cyclostomes</i>, and that it is far more highly specialized
than any of them. In a still later paper (1904) Dr. Dean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
shows that the fossil might as easily be considered a Chim&aelig;ra
as a lamprey, and repeats his conviction that it is a larval
form of which the adult is still unrecognized.</p>

<p>We cannot go much farther than Dr. Dean's statement in
1896, that it belongs "among the curiously specialized offshoots
of the early Chordates."</p>

THE CROSSOPTERYGII</h2>

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_598.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">Class</span> Teleostomi.</b>&mdash;We may unite the remaining groups
of fishes into a single class, for which the name <i>Teleostomi</i>
(&#964;&#8051;&#955;&#949;&#959;&#962;, true; &#963;&#964;&#8057;&#956;&#945;, mouth), proposed by Bonaparte
in 1838, may be retained. The fishes of this class are
characterized by the presence of a suspensorium to the mandible,
by the existence of membrane-bones (opercles, suborbitals,
etc.) on the head, by a single gill-opening leading to
gill-arches bearing filamentous gills, and by the absence of
claspers on the ventral fins. The skeleton is at least partly
ossified in all the <i>Teleostomi</i>. More important as a primary
character, distinguishing these fishes from the sharks, is the
presence typically and primitively of the air-bladder. This
is at first a lung, arising as a diverticulum from the ventral side
of the &oelig;sophagus, but in later forms it becomes dorsal and is,
by degrees, degraded into a swim-bladder, and in very many
forms it is altogether lost with age.</p>

<p>This group comprises the vast majority of recent fishes,
as well as a large percentage of those known only as fossils.
In these the condition of the lung can be only guessed.</p>

<p>The <i>Teleostomi</i> are doubtless derived from sharks, their
relationship being possibly nearest to the <i>Ichthyotomi</i> or to the
primitive <i>Chim&aelig;ras</i>. The Dipnoans among <i>Teleostomi</i> retain
the shark-like condition of the upper jaw, made of palatal
elements, which may be, as in the <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i>, fused with the cranium.
In the lower forms also the primitive diphycercal or
protocercal form of tail is retained, as also the archipterygium
or jointed axis of the paired fins, fringed with rays on one or
both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span></p>

<p>We may divide the Teleostomes, or true fishes, into three
subclasses: the <i>Crossopterygii</i>, or fringe-fins; the <i>Dipneusti</i>, or
lung-fishes; <i>Actinopteri</i>, or ray-fins, including the <i>Ganoidei</i> and
the <i>Teleostei</i>, or bony fishes. Of these many recent writers are
disposed to consider the <i>Crossopterygii</i> as most primitive, and
to derive from it by separate lines each of the remaining subclasses,
as well as the higher vertebrates. The <i>Ganoidei</i> and
<i>Teleostei</i> (constituting the <i>Actinopteri</i>) are very closely related,
the ancient group passing by almost imperceptible degrees into
the modern group of bony fishes.</p>

<p><b>Subclass Crossopterygii.</b>&mdash;The earliest Teleostomes known
belong to the subclass or group called after Huxley, <i>Crossopterygii</i>
(&#954;&#961;&#8057;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#962;, fringe; &#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#8059;&#958;, fin). A prominent character of
the group lies in the retention of the jointed pectoral fin or archipterygium,
its axis fringed by a series of soft rays. This character
it shares with the <i>Ichthyotomi</i> among sharks, and with
the <i>Dipneusti</i>. From the latter it differs in the hyostylic cranium,
the lower jaw being suspended from the hyomandibular,
and by the presence of distinct premaxillary and maxillary
elements in the upper jaw. In these characters it agrees with
the ordinary fishes. In the living Crossopterygians the air-bladder
is lung-like, attached by a duct to the ventral side
of the &oelig;sophagus. The lung-sac, though specialized in structure,
is simple, not cellular as in the Dipnoans. The skeleton
is more or less perfectly ossified. Outside the cartilaginous
skull is a bony coat of mail. The skin is covered with firm
scales or bony plates, the tail is diphycercal, straight, and ending
in a point, the shoulder-girdle attached to the cranium is
cartilaginous but overlaid with bony plates, and the branchiostegals
are represented by a pair of gular plates.</p>

<p>In the single family represented among living fishes the
heart has a muscular arterial bulb with many series of valves
on its inner edge, and the large air-bladder is divided into two
lobes, having the functions of a lung, though not cellular as in
the lung-fishes.</p>

<p>The fossil types are very closely allied to the lung-fishes,
and the two groups have no doubt a common origin in Silurian
times. It is now usually considered that the Crossopterygian
is more primitive than the lung-fish, though at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
more nearly related to the Ganoids, and through them to the
ordinary fishes.</p>

<p><b>Origin of Amphibians.</b>&mdash;From the primitive <i>Crossopterygii</i>
the step to the ancestral <i>Amphibia</i>, which are likewise mailed
and semi-aquatic, seems a very short one. It is true that most
writers until recently have regarded certain Dipneustans as
the <i>Dipterid&aelig;</i> as representing the parents of the Amphibians.
But the weight of recent authority, Gill, Pollard, Boulenger,
Dollo, and others, seems to place the point of separation of the
higher vertebrates with the Crossopterygians, and to regard
the lobate pectoral member of <i>Polypterus</i> as a possible source of
the five-fingered arm of the frog. This view is still, however, extremely
hypothetical and there is still much to be said in favor
of the theory of the origin of Amphibia from Dipnoans and in
favor of the view that the Dipnoans are also ancestors of the
Crossopterygians.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_600.jpg" width="700" height="419" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 370.</span>&mdash;Shoulder-girdle of <i>Polypterus bichir</i>. Specimen from the White Nile.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the true Amphibians the lungs are better developed
than in the Crossopterygian or Dipnoan, although the lungs are
finally lost in certain salamanders which breathe through epithelial
cells. The gills lose, among the Amphibia, their primitive
importance, although in <i>Proteus anguineus</i> of Austria and
<i>Necturus maculosus</i>, the American "mud-puppy" or water-dog,
these persist through life. The archipterygium, or primitive
fin, gives place to the chiropterygium, or fingered arm. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
this the basal segment of the archipterygium gives place to
the humerus, the diverging segments seen in the most specialized
type of archipterygium (<i>Polypterus</i>) become perhaps radius
and ulna, the intermediate quadrate mass of cartilage possibly
becoming carpal bones, and from these spring the joints called
metacarpals and phalanges. In the Amphibians and all higher
forms the shoulder-girdle retains its primitive insertion at a
distance from the head, and
the posterior limbs remain
abdominal.</p>

<p>The Amphibians are therefore
primarily fishes with
fingers and toes instead of
the fringe-fins of their ancestors.
Their relations are
really with the fishes, as
indicated by Huxley, who
unites the amphibians and
fishes in a primary group,
<i>Ichthyopsida</i>, while reptiles
and birds form the contrasting group of <i>Sauropsida</i>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_601.jpg" width="700" height="632" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 371.</span>&mdash;Arm of a frog.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The reptiles differ from the Amphibians through acceleration
of development, passing through the gill-bearing stages
within the egg. The birds bear feathers instead of scales,
and the mammals nourish their young by means of glandular
secretions. Through a reptile-amphibian ancestry the birds
and mammals may trace back their descent from pal&aelig;ozoic
Crossopterygians. In the very young embryo of all higher
vertebrates traces of double-breathing persist in all species,
in the form of rudimentary gill-slits.</p>

<p><b>The Fins of Crossopterygians.</b>&mdash;Dollo and Boulenger regard
the heterocercal tail as a primitive form, the diphycercal form
being a result of degradation, connected with its less extensive
use as an organ of propulsion. Most writers who adopt the
theory of Gegenbaur that the archipterygium is the primitive
form of the pectoral fin are likely, however, to consider the
diphycercal tail found associated with it in the <i>Ichthyotomi</i>,
<i>Dipneusti</i>, <i>Crossopterygii</i> as the more primitive form of the tail.
From this form the heterocercal tail of the higher sharks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
Ganoids may be derived, this giving way in the process of development
to the imperfectly homocercal tail of the salmon,
the homocercal tail of the perch, and the isocercal tail of the
codfish and its allies, the gephyrocercal and the leptocercal tail,
tapering or whip-like, representing various stages of degeneration.
Boulenger draws a distinction between the protocercal
tail, the one primitively straight, and the diphycercal tail
modified, like the homocercal tail, from an heterocercal ancestry.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Orders of Crossopterygians.</b>&mdash;Cope and Woodward divide the
<i>Crossopterygia</i> into four orders or suborders, <i>Haplistia</i>, <i>Rhipidistia</i>,
<i>Actinistia</i>, and <i>Cladistia</i>. To the latter belong the existing
species, or the family of <i>Polypterid&aelig;</i>, alone. Boulenger unites
the three extinct orders into one, which he calls <i>Osteolepida</i>.
In all three of these the pectorals are narrow with a single basal
bone, and the nostrils, as in the Dipneustans, are below the
snout. The differences are apparently such as to justify Cope's
division into three orders.</p>

<p><b>Haplistia.</b>&mdash;In the <i>Haplistia</i> the notochord is persistent, and
the basal bones of dorsal and anal fins are in regular series,
much fewer in number than the fin-rays. The single family
<i>Tarrassiid&aelig;</i> is represented by <i>Tarrasius problematicus</i>, found
by Traquair in Scotland. This is regarded as the lowest of the
Crossopterygians, a small fish of the Lower Carboniferous, the
head mailed, the body with small bony scales.</p>

<p><b>Rhipidistia.</b>&mdash;In the <i>Rhipidistia</i> the basal bones of the median
fins ("axonosts and baseosts") are found in a single piece, not
separate as in the <i>Haplistia</i>. Four families are recognized,
<i>Holoptychiid&aelig;</i>, <i>Megalichthyid&aelig;</i>, <i>Osteolepid&aelig;</i>, and <i>Onychodontid&aelig;</i>,
the first of these being considered as the nearest approach of
the Crossopterygians to the Dipnoans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Holoptychiid&aelig;</i> have the pectoral fins acute, the scales
cycloid, enameled, and the teeth very complex. <i>Holoptychius
nobilissimus</i> is a very large fish from the Devonian. <i>Glyptolepis
leptopterus</i> from the Lower Devonian is also a notable species.
<i>Dendrodus</i> from the Devonian is known from detached teeth.</p>

(After Woodward.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the Ordovician rocks of Ca&ntilde;on City, Colorado, Dr. Walcott
finds numerous bony scales with folded surfaces and stellate
ornamentation, and which he refers with some doubt to a
Crossopterygian fish of the family <i>Holoptychiid&aelig;</i>. This fish he
names <i>Eriptychius americanus</i>. If this identification proves correct,
it will carry back the appearance of Crossopterygian fishes,
the earliest of the Teleostome forms, to the beginning of the
Silurian, these Ca&ntilde;on City shales being the oldest rocks in which
remains of fishes are known to occur. In the same rocks are
found plates of Ostracophores and other fragments still
more doubtful. It is certain that our records in pal&aelig;ontology
fall far short of disclosing the earliest sharks, as well as
the earliest remains of Ostracophores, Arthrodires, or even
Ganoids.</p>

<p><b>Megalichthyid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The <i>Megalichthyid&aelig;</i> (wrongly called "<i>Rhizodontid&aelig;</i>")
have the pectoral fins obtuse, the teeth relatively
simple, and the scales cycloid, enameled. There are numerous
species in the Carboniferous rocks, largely known from
fragments or from teeth. <i>Megalichthys</i>, <i>Strepsodus</i>, <i>Rhizodopsis</i>,
<i>Gyroptychius</i>, <i>Tristichopterus</i>, <i>Eusthenopteron</i>, <i>Cricodus</i>,
and <i>Sauripterus</i> are the genera; <i>Rhizodopsis sauroides</i> from
the coal-measures of England being the best-known species.</p>

<p>The <i>Osteolepid&aelig;</i> differ from the <i>Megalichthyid&aelig;</i> mainly in
the presence of enameled rhomboid scales, as in <i>Polypterus</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
<i>Lepisosteus</i>. In <i>Glyptopomus</i> these scales are sculptured, in
the others smooth. In <i>Osteolepis</i>, <i>Thursius</i>, <i>Diplopterus</i>, and
<i>Glyptopomus</i> a pineal foramen is present on the top of the head.
This is wanting in <i>Parabatrachus</i> (<i>Megalichthys</i> of authors).
In <i>Osteolepis</i>, <i>Thursius</i>, and <i>Parabatrachus</i> the tail is heterocercal,
while in <i>Diplopterus</i> and <i>Glyptopomus</i> it is diphycercal. <i>Osteolepis
macrolepidotus</i> and numerous other species occur in the
Lower Devonian. <i>Diplopterus agassizii</i> is common in the same
horizon. <i>Megalichthys hibberti</i> is found in the coal-measures,
and <i>Glyptopomus minimus</i> in the Upper Devonian. <i>Pal&aelig;osteus</i>
is another genus recently described.</p>

<p>The <i>Onychodontid&aelig;</i> are known from a few fragments of
<i>Onychodus sigmoides</i> from the Lower Devonian of Ohio and
<i>Onychodus anglicus</i> from England.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Order Actinistia.</b>&mdash;In the <i>Actinistia</i> there is a single fin-ray
to each basal bone, the axonosts of each ray fused in a single
piece. The notochord is persistent, causing the back-bone
in fossils to appear hollow, the cartilaginous material leaving
no trace in the rocks. The genera and species are numerous,
ranging from the Subcarboniferous to the Upper Cretaceous,
many of them belonging to <i>C&oelig;lacanthus</i>, the chief genus of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
single family <i>C&oelig;lacanthid&aelig;</i>. In <i>C&oelig;lacanthus</i> the fin-rays are
without denticles. <i>C&oelig;lacanthus granulatus</i> is found in the
European Permian. <i>C&oelig;lacanthus elegans</i> of the coal-measures
is found in America also. In <i>Undina</i> the anterior fin-rays are
marked with tubercles. <i>Undina penicillata</i> and <i>Undina gulo</i>
from the Triassic are well-preserved species. In <i>Macropoma</i>
(<i>lewesiensis</i>) the fin-rays are robust, long, and little articulated.
Other genera are <i>Heptanema</i>, <i>Coccoderma</i>, <i>Libys</i>, <i>Diplurus</i>,
and <i>Graphiurus</i>. <i>Diplurus longicaudatus</i> was found by Newberry
in the Triassic of New Jersey and Connecticut.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Order Cladistia.</b>&mdash;In the <i>Cladistia</i> the axis of the pectoral
limb is fan-shaped, made of two diversified bones joined by
cartilage. The notochord is restricted and replaced by ossified
vertebr&aelig;. The axonosts of the dorsal and anal are in
regular series, each bearing a fin-ray. The order contains the
single family <i>Polypterid&aelig;</i>. In this group the pectoral fin is
formed differently from that of the other Crossopterygians,
being broad, its base of two diverging bones with cartilage
between. This structure, more specialized than in any other
of the Crossopterygians or <i>Dipneusti</i>, has been regarded by
Gill and others, as above stated, as the origin of the fingered
hand (chiropterygium) of the frogs and higher vertebrates.
The base of the diverging bones has been identified as the antecedent
of the humerus, the bones themselves as radius and
ulna, while the intervening non-ossified cartilage breaks up
into carpal bones, from which metacarpals and digits ultimately
diverge. This hypothesis is open to considerable doubt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
The nostrils, as in true fishes, are superior. The body in these
fishes is covered with rhombic enameled scales, as in the garpike;
the head is similarly mailed, but, in distinction from the
garpike, the anterior rays of the dorsal are developed as isolated
spines.</p>

<p>The young have a bushy external gill with a broad scaly
base. The air-bladder is double, not cellular, with a large
air-duct joining the ventral surface of the &oelig;sophagus. The
intestine has a spiral valve.</p>

<p>The cranium, according to Boulenger ("Poissons du Bassin
du Congo," p. 11), is remarkable for its generalized form, this character
forming a trait of union between the Ganoids and the primitive
<i>Amphibia</i> or <i>Stegocephali</i>. Without considering <i>Polypterus</i>,
it is not possible to interpret the homologies of the cranium
of the amphibians and the sharks.</p>

<p>The jaws are similar to those of the vertebrates higher than
fishes. Tooth-bearing premaxillaries and dentaries are solidly
joined at the front of the cranium, and united by a suture to
the toothed maxillaries which form most of the edge of the
mouth. Each half of the lower jaw consists of four elements,
covering Meckel's cartilage, which is ossified at the symphysis.
These are the articular, angular, dentary, and splenial (coronoid).
Most of these bones are armed with teeth. The
palato-suspensory consists of hyomandibular, quadrate, ectopterygoid,
entopterygoid, metapterygoid, and
palatine elements, the pterygoid elements bearing
teeth. In <i>Erpetoichthys</i> only the opercle is distinct
among the gill-covers. In <i>Polypterus</i> there
is a subopercle also; the suborbital chain is
represented by two small bones.</p>

<p>The gill-arches are four, but without lower
pharyngeals. The teeth are conic and pointed,
and in structure, according to Agassiz, they
differ largely from those of bony fishes, approaching
the teeth of reptiles.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 372px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 377.</span>&mdash;Lower
jaw of <i>Polypterus
bichir</i>, from
below.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The external gill of the young, first discovered
by Steindachner in 1869, consists of a fleshy axis bordered above
and below by secondary branches, themselves fringed. In form
and structure this resembles the external gills of amphibians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
It is inserted, not on the gill-arches, but on the hyoid arch.
Its origin is from the external skin. It can therefore not be
compared morphologically with the gills of other fishes, nor
with the pseudobranchi&aelig;, but rather with the external gills
of larval sharks. The vertebr&aelig; are very numerous and biconcave
as in ordinary fishes. Each of the peculiar dorsal
spines is primitively a single spine, not a finlet of several pieces,
as some have suggested. The enameled, rhomboid scales are
in movable oblique whorls, each scale interlocked with its
neighbors.</p>

</div>

<p>The shoulder-girdle, suspended from the cranium by post-temporal
and supraclavicle, is covered by bony plates. To the
small hypercoracoid and hypocoracoid the pectoral fin is attached.
Its basal bones may be compared to those of the
sharks, mesopterygium, propterygium, and metapterygium,
which may with less certainty be again called humerus, radius,
and ulna. These are covered by flesh and by small imbricated
scales. The air-bladder resembles the lungs of terrestrial
vertebrates. It consists of two cylindrical sacs, that on the
right the longer, then uniting in front to form a short tube,
which enters the &oelig;sophagus from below with a slit-like glottis.
Unlike the lung of the <i>Dipneusti</i>, this air-bladder is not cellular,
and it receives only arterial blood. Its function is to assist
the respiration by gills without replacing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Polypterid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;All the <i>Polypterid&aelig;</i> are natives of Africa.
Two genera are known, no species having been found fossil.
Of <i>Polypterus</i>, Boulenger, the latest authority, recognizes nine
species: six in the Congo, <i>Polypterus congicus</i>, <i>P. delhezi</i>, <i>P.
ornatipinnis</i>, <i>P. weeksi</i>, <i>P. palmas</i>, and <i>P. retropinnis</i>; one, <i>P.
lapradei</i>, in the Niger; and two in the Nile, <i>Polypterus bichir</i> and
<i>P. endlicheri</i>. Of these the only one known until very recently
was <i>Polypterus bichir</i> of the Nile.</p>

<p>These fishes in many respects resemble the garpike in
habits. They live close on the mud in the bottom of sluggish
waters, moving the pectorals fan-fashion. If the water is
foul, they rise to the surface to gulp air, a part of which escapes
through the gill-openings, after which they descend like a flash.
In the breeding season these fishes are very active, depositing
their eggs in districts flooded in the spring. The eggs are very
numerous, grass-green, and of the size of eggs of millet. The
flesh is excellent as food.</p>

But these two names, both wrongly spelled for <i>Herpetichthys</i>, are sufficiently
different, and the earlier name should be retained. "A name in science is a

Furthermore, if names are spelled differently, they are different, whatever
their meaning. The efforts of ornithologists, notably those of Dr. Coues,
to spell correctly improperly formed generic names have shown that to do
so consistently would throw nomenclature into utter confusion. It is well
that generic names of classic origin should be correctly formed. It is vastly

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><b><span class="smcap">The</span> Lungfishes.</b>&mdash;The group of Dipneusti, or lung-fishes,
is characterized by the presence of paired fins
consisting of a jointed axis with or without rays.
The skull is autostylic, the upper jaw being made as in the
Chim&aelig;ra of palatal elements joined to the quadrate and fused
with the cranium, without premaxillary or maxillary. The
dentary bones are little developed. The air-bladder is cellular,
used as a lung in all the living species, its duct attached to the
ventral side of the &oelig;sophagus. The heart has many valves in
the muscular arterial bulb. The intestine has a spiral valve.
The teeth are usually of large plates of dentine covered with
enamel, and are present on the pterygo-palatine and splenial
bones. The nostrils are concealed, when the mouth is closed,
under a fold of the upper lip. The scales are cycloid, mostly
not enameled.</p>

</div>

<p>The lung-fishes, or <i>Dipneusti</i> (&#948;&#8055;&#962;, two; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, to breathe),
arise, with the Crossopterygians, from the vast darkness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>Pal&aelig;ozoic time, their origin with that or through that of the
latter to be traced to the Ichthyotomi or other primitive sharks.
These two groups are separated from all the more primitive
fish-like vertebrates by the presence of lungs. In its origin
the lung or air-bladder arises as a diverticulum from the alimentary
canal, used by the earliest fishes as a breathing-sac,
the respiratory functions lost in the progress of further divergence.
Nothing of the nature of lung or air-bladder is
found in lancelet, lamprey, or shark. In none of the remaining
groups of fishes is it wholly wanting at all stages of development,
although often lost in the adult. Among fishes it is most
completely functional in the <i>Dipneusti</i>, and it passes through
all stages of degeneration and atrophy in the more specialized
bony fishes.</p>

<p>In the <i>Dipneusti</i>, or Dipnoans, as in the Crossopterygians
and the higher vertebrates, the trachea, or air-duct, arises, as
above stated, from the ventral side of the &oelig;sophagus. In the
more specialized fishes, yet to be considered, it is transferred
to the dorsal side, thus avoiding a turn in passing around the
&oelig;sophagus itself. From the sharks these forms are further
distinguished by the presence of membrane-bones about the
head. From the <i>Actinopteri</i> (Ganoids and Teleosts) Dipnoans
and Crossopterygians are again distinguished by the presence
of the fringe-fin, or archipterygium, as the form of the paired
limbs. From the Crossopterygians the Dipnoans are most
readily distinguished by the absence of maxillary and premaxillary,
the characteristic structures of the jaw of the true
fish. The upper jaw in the Dipnoan is formed of palatal elements
attached directly to the skull, and the lower jaw contains
no true dentary bones. The skull in the Dipnoans, as
in the <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i>, is autostylic, the mandible articulating directly
with the palatal apparatus, the front of which forms the upper
jaw and of which the pterygoid, hyomandibular and quadrate
elements form an immovable part. The shoulder-girdle, as
in the shark, is a single cartilage, but it supports a pair of superficial
membrane-bones.</p>

<p>In all the Dipnoans the trunk is covered with imbricated
cycloid scales and no bony plates, although sometimes the
scales are firm and enameled. The head has a roof of well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>-developed
bony plates made of ossified skin and not corresponding
with the membrane-bones of higher fishes. The fish-like
membrane-bones, opercles, branchiostegals, etc., are not
yet differentiated. The teeth have the form of grinding-plates
on the pterygoid areas of the palate, being distinctly shark-like
in structure. The paired fins are developed as archipterygia,
often without rays, and the pelvic arch consists of a single
cartilage, the two sides symmetrical and connected in front.
There is but one external gill-opening leading to the gill-arches,
which, as in ordinary fishes, are fringe-like, attached at one
end. In the young, as with the embryo shark, there is a bushy
external gill, which looks not unlike the archipterygium pectoral
fin itself, although its rays are of different texture. In
early forms, as in the Ganoids, the scales were bony and enameled,
but in some recent forms deep sunken in the skin. The
claspers have disappeared, the nostrils, as in the frog, open
into the pharynx, the heart is three-chambered, the arterial
bulb with many valves, and the cellular structure of the skin
and of other tissues is essentially as in the Amphibian.</p>

<p>The developed lung, fitted for breathing air, which seems
the most important of all these characters, can, of course, be
traced only in the recent forms, although its existence in all
others can be safely predicated. Besides the development
of the lung we may notice the gradual forward movement
of the shoulder-girdle, which in most of the Teleostomous
fishes is attached to the head. In bony fishes generally
there is no distinct neck, as the post-temporal, the highest
bone of the shoulder-girdle, is articulated directly with the
skull. In some specialized forms (<i>Balistes</i>, <i>Tetraodon</i>) it is
even immovably fused with it. In a few groups (<i>Apodes</i>,
<i>Opisthomi</i>, <i>Heteromi</i>, etc.) this connection ancestrally possessed
is lost through atrophy and the slipping backward of the
shoulder-girdle leaves again a distinct neck. In the Amphibians
and all higher vertebrates the shoulder-girdle is distinct
from the skull, and the possession of a flexible neck is
an important feature of their structure. In all these higher
forms the posterior limbs remain abdominal, as in the sharks
and the primitive and soft-rayed fishes generally. In these
the pelvis or pelvic elements are attached toward the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
of the body, giving a distinct back as well as neck. In the
spiny-rayed fishes the "back" as well as the neck disappears,
the pelvic elements being attached to the shoulder-girdle, and
in a few extreme forms (as <i>Ophidion</i>) the pelvis is fastened at
the chin.</p>

<p><b>Classification of Dipnoans.</b>&mdash;By Woodward the <i>Dipneusti</i> are
divided into two classes, the <i>Sirenoidei</i> and the <i>Arthrodira</i>.
We follow Dean in regarding the latter as representative of a
distinct class, leaving the <i>Sirenoidei</i>, with the <i>Ctenodipterini</i>,
to constitute the subclass of <i>Dipneusti</i>. The <i>Sirenoidei</i> are
divided by Gill into two orders, the <i>Monopneumona</i>, with one
lung, and the <i>Diplopneumona</i>, with the lung divided. To the
latter order the <i>Lepidosirenid&aelig;</i> belong. To the former the
<i>Ceratodontid&aelig;</i>, and presumably the extinct families also belong,
although nothing is known of their lung structures. Zittel
and Hay adopt the names of <i>Ctenodipterini</i> and <i>Sirenoidei</i> for
these orders, the former being further characterized by the very
fine fin-rays, more numerous than their supports.</p>

<p><b>Order Ctenodipterini.</b>&mdash;In this order the cranial roof-bones
are small and numerous, and the rays of the median fins are
very slender, much more numerous than their supports, which
are inserted directly on the vertebral arches.</p>

<p>In the <i>Uronemid&aelig;</i> the upper dentition comprises a cluster
of small, blunt, conical denticles on the palatine bones; the
lower dentition consists of similar denticles on the splenial
bone. The vertical fins are continuous and the tail diphycercal.
There is a jugular plate, as in <i>Amia</i>. The few species are found
in the Carboniferous, <i>Uronemus lobatus</i> being the best-known
species.</p>

<p>In <i>Dipterid&aelig;</i> there is a pair of dental plates on the palatines,
and an opposing pair on the splenials below. Jugular plates
are present, and the tail is usually distinctly heterocercal.</p>

<p>In <i>Phaneropleuron</i> there is a distinct anal fin shorter than
the very long dorsal; <i>Phaneropleuron andersoni</i> is known from
Scotland, and <i>Scaumenacia curta</i> is found at Scaumenac Bay
in the Upper Devonian of Canada.</p>

<p>In <i>Dipterus</i> there are no marginal teeth, and the tail is
heterocercal, not diphycercal, as in the other Dipnoans generally.
Numerous species of <i>Dipterus</i> occur in Devonian rocks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
In these the jugular plate is present, as in <i>Uronemus</i>. <i>Dipterus
valenciennesi</i> is the best-known European species. <i>Dipterus
nelsoni</i> and numerous other species are found in the Chemung
and other groups of Devonian rocks in America.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 382.</span>&mdash;<i>Phaneropleuron andersoni</i> Huxley; restored; Devonian. (After Dean.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the <i>Ctenodontid&aelig;</i> the tail is diphycercal, and no jugular
plates are present in the known specimens. In <i>Ctenodus</i> and
<i>Sagenodus</i> there is no jugular plate and there are no marginal
teeth. The numerous species of <i>Ctenodus</i> and <i>Sagenodus</i> belong
chiefly to the Carboniferous age. <i>Ctenodus wagneri</i> is found in
the Cleveland shale of the Ohio Devonian. <i>Sagenodus occidentalis</i>,
one of the many American species, belongs to the coal-measures
of Illinois.</p>

<p>As regards the succession of the <i>Dipneusti</i>, Dr. Dollo regards
<i>Dipterus</i> as the most primitive, <i>Scaumenacia</i>, <i>Uronemus</i>,
<i>Ctenodus</i>, <i>Ceratodus</i>, <i>Protopterus</i>, and <i>Lepidosiren</i> following
in order. The last-named genus he thinks marks the terminus
of the group, neither Ganoids nor Amphibians being derived
from any Dipnoans.</p>

<p><b>Order Sirenoidei.</b>&mdash;The living families of <i>Dipneusti</i> differ
from these extinct types in having the cranial roof-bones reduced
in number. There are no jugular plates and no marginal
teeth in the jaws. The tail is diphycercal in all, ending in a
long point, and the body is covered with cycloid scales. To
these forms the name <i>Sirenoidei</i> was applied by Johannes
M&uuml;ller.</p>

<p><b>Family Ceratodontid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The <i>Ceratodontid&aelig;</i> have the teeth
above and below developed as triangular plates, set obliquely
each with several cusps on the outer margin. Nearly all the
species, representing the genera <i>Ceratodus</i>, <i>Gosfordia</i>, and <i>Conchopoma</i>,
are now extinct, the single genus <i>Neoceratodus</i> still
existing in Australian rivers. Numerous fragments of <i>Ceratodus</i>
are found in Mesozoic rocks in Europe, Colorado, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>
India, <i>Ceratodus latissimus</i>, figured
by Agassiz in 1838, being the best-known
species.</p>

<p>The abundance of the fossil teeth
of <i>Ceratodus</i> renders the discovery of
a living representative of the same
type a matter of great interest.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1870 the Barramunda of the
rivers of Queensland was described
by Krefft, who recognized its relationship
to <i>Ceratodus</i> and gave it the
name of <i>Ceratodus forsteri</i>. Later,
generic differences were noticed, and
it was separated as a distinct group
by Castelnau in 1876, under the name
of <i>Neoceratodus</i> (later called <i>Epiceratodus</i>
by Teller). <i>Neoceratodus forsteri</i>
and a second species, <i>Neoceratodus miolepis</i>,
have been since very fully discussed
by Dr. G&uuml;nther and Dr. Krefft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
They are known in Queensland as <i>Barramunda</i>. They inhabit the
rivers known as Burnett, Dawson, and Mary, reaching a length
of six feet, and being locally much valued as food. From the
salmon-colored flesh, they are known to the settlers in Queensland
as "salmon." According to Dr. G&uuml;nther, "the Barramunda
is said to be in the habit of going on land, or at least
on mud-flats; and this assertion appears to be borne out by
the fact that it is provided with a lung. However, it is much
more probable that it rises now and then to the surface of the
water in order to fill its lung with air, and then descends again
until the air is so much deoxygenized as to render a renewal
of it necessary. It is also said to make a grunting noise which
may be heard at night for some distance. This noise is probably
produced by the passage of the air through the &oelig;sophagus
when it is expelled for the purpose of renewal. As the Barramunda
has perfectly developed gills besides the lung, we can
hardly doubt that, when it is in water of normal composition
and sufficiently pure to yield the necessary supply of oxygen,
these organs are sufficient for the purpose of breathing, and
that the respiratory function rests with them alone. But
when the fish is compelled to sojourn in thick muddy water
charged with gases, which are the
products of decomposing organic
matter (and this must be the case
very frequently during the droughts
which annually exhaust the creeks
of tropical Australia), it commences
to breathe air with its lung in the
way indicated above. If the medium
in which it happens to be is perfectly
unfit for breathing, the gills cease to
have any function; if only in a less
degree, the gills may still continue
to assist in respiration. The Barramunda,
in fact, can breathe by either
gills or lung alone or by both simultaneously.
It is not probable that
it lives freely out of water, its limbs being much too flexible
for supporting the heavy and unwieldy body and too feeble
generally to be of much use in locomotion on land. However,
it is quite possible that it is occasionally compelled to
leave the water, although we cannot believe that it can exist
without it in a lively condition for any length of time.</p>

<p>"Of its propagation or development we know nothing except
that it deposits a great number of eggs of the size of those of
a newt, and enveloped in a gelatinous case. We may infer
that the young are provided with external gills, as in <i>Protopterus</i>
and <i>Polypterus</i>.</p>

<p>"The discovery of <i>Ceratodus</i> does not date farther back
than the year 1870, and proved to be of
the greatest interest, not only on account
of the relation of this creature to the other
living <i>Dipneusti</i> and <i>Ganoidei</i>, but also
because it threw fresh light on those
singular fossil teeth which are found in
strata of Triassic and Jurassic formations
in various parts of Europe, India, and
America. These teeth, of which there
is a great variety with regard to general
shape and size, are sometimes two inches long, much longer
than broad, depressed, with a flat or slightly undulated, always
punctated, crown, with one margin convex, and with from
three to seven prongs projecting on the opposite margin."</p>

<p><b>Development of Neoceratodus.</b>&mdash;From <span class="smcap">Dean's</span> "Fishes, Recent
and Fossil," pp. 218-221, we condense the following account
(after the observations of Dr. F. Semon) of the larval history
of the Barramunda, <i>Neoceratodus forsteri</i>:</p>

<p>It offers characters of exceptional interest, uniting features
of Ganoids with those of Cyclostomes and Amphibians.</p>

<p>The newly hatched <i>Neoceratodus</i> does not strikingly resemble
the early larva of shark. No yolk-sac occurs, and the
distribution of the yolk material in the ventral and especially
the hinder ventral region is suggestive rather of lamprey or
amphibian; it is, in fact, as though the quantum of yolk material
had been so reduced that the body form had not been constricted
off from it. The caudal tip in this stage appears, however,
to resemble that of the shark, and, as far as can be inferred
from surface views, a neurenteric canal persists. Like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
shark there then exists no unpaired fin; the gill-slits (five?)
are well separated and there is an abrupt cephalic flexure.
In this stage pronephros (primitive kidney) and primitive
segments are well marked, and are outwardly similar to those
structures in Ganoid; the mouth is on the point of forming its
connection with the digestive cavity; the anus is the persistent
blastophore; the heart, well established, takes a position, as
in Cyclostomes, immediately in front of the yolk material.</p>

<p>In a later stage the unpaired fin has become perfectly
established, the tail increasing in length; the gill-slits have
now been almost entirely concealed by a surrounding dermal
outgrowth, the embryonic operculum; a trace of the pectoral
fin appears; the lateral line is seen proceeding down the side
of the body; near the anal region the intestine<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> becomes narrower,
and the beginnings of the spiral valve appear. In a
larva of two weeks a number of developmental advances are
noticed; the fish has become opaque; the primitive segments
are no longer seen; the size of the yolk mass is reduced; the
anal fin-fold appears; sensory canals are prominent in the head
region; lateral line is completely established; the rectum becomes
narrowed; and the cycloidal body-scales are already
outlined. Gill-filaments may still be seen beyond the rim of
the outgrowing operculum. In the ventral view of a somewhat
later larva the following structures are to be noted: the
pectoral fins, which have now suddenly budded out,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> reminding
one in their late appearance of the mode of origin of the anterior
extremity of urodele; the greatly enlarged size of the opercular
flap; external gills, still prominent; the internal nares, becoming
constricted off into the mouth-cavity by the dermal
fold of the anterior lip (as in some sharks); and finally (as in
<i>Protopterus</i> and some batrachian larv&aelig;) the one-sided position
of the anus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span></p>

<p>The larva of six weeks suggests the outline of the mature
fish; head and sides show the various openings of the tubules
of the insunken sensory canals; and the archipterygium of
the pectoral fin is well defined. The oldest larva figured is
ten weeks old; its operculum and pectoral fin show an increased
size; the tubular mucous openings, becoming finely subdivided,
are no longer noticeable; and although the basal supports of
the remaining fins are coming to be established, there is as yet
little more than a trace of the ventrals.</p>

<p>The early development of a lung-fish has thus far been
described (Semon) only from the outward appearance of the
embryo. The egg of <i>Neoceratodus</i> has its upper pole distinguished
by its fine covering of pigment. From the first fine
planes of cleavage it will be seen that the yolk material of the
lower pole is not sufficient to prevent the egg's total segmentation.
The first plane of cleavage is a vertical one, passing
down the side of the egg as a shallow surface furrow, not appearing
to entirely separate the substance of the blastomeres, although
traversing completely the lower hemisphere. A second
vertical furrow at right angles to the first is seen from the upper
pole. The third cleavage is again a vertical one (as in all other
fishes, but unlike <i>Petromyzon</i>), approximately meridional; its
furrows appear less clearly marked than those of earlier cleavages,
and seem somewhat irregular in occurrence. The fourth cleavage
is horizontal above the plane of the equator. Judging from
Semon's figure, at this stage the furrows of the lower pole seem
to have become fainter, if not entirely lost. In a blastula
showing complete segmentation the blastomeres of the upper
hemisphere are the more finely subdivided. In the earlier
stage the dorsal lip of the blastopore is crescent-like; in the
later the blastopore acquires its oblong outline, through which
the yolk material is apparent; its conditions may later be compared
to those of a Ganoid.</p>

<p>The next change of the embryo is strikingly amphibian-like;
the medullary folds rise above the egg's surface, and, arching
over, fuse their edges in the median dorsal line. The medullary
folds are seen closely apposed in the median line; hindward,
however, they are still separate, and through this opening the
blastopore may yet be seen. At this stage primitive segments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
are shown; in the brain region the medullary folds are still
slightly separated.</p>

<p>In an older embryo the fish-like form may be recognized.
The medullary folds have completely fused in the median line,
and the embryo is coming to acquire a ridge-like prominence;
optic vesicles and primitive segments are apparent, and the
blastopore appears to persist as the anus. The continued
growth of the embryo above the yolk mass is apparent; the head
end has, however, grown the more rapidly, showing gill-slits,
auditory, optic, and nasal vesicles, at a time when the tail mass
has hardly emerged from the surface. Pronephros has here
appeared. It is not until the stage of the late embryo that the
hinder trunk region and tail come to be prominent. The embryo's
axis elongates and becomes straighter; the yolk mass
is now much reduced, acquiring a more and more oblong form,
lying in front of the tail in the region of the posterior gut. The
head and even the region of the <i>pronephros</i> are clearly separate
from the yolk-sac; the mouth is coming to be formed.</p>

<p>According to Eastman (Ed. Zittel), the skeleton of <i>Neoceratodus</i>
is less developed and less ossified than that of its
supposed Triassic ancestors. A similar rule holds with regard
to the sturgeons and some Amphibians.</p>

<p><b>Lepidosirenid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The family <i>Lepidosirenid&aelig;</i>, representing the
suborder <i>Diplopneumona</i>, is represented by two genera of mudfishes
found in streams of Africa and South America.
<i>Lepidosiren paradoxa</i> was discovered by Natterer in 1837 in
tributaries of the Amazon. It was long of great rarity in
collections, but quite recently large numbers have been obtained,
and Dr. J. Graham Kerr of the University of Cambridge
has given a very useful account of its structure and development.
From his memoir we condense the following record
of its habits as seen in the swamps in a region known as Gran
Chaco, which lies under the Tropic of Capricorn. These swamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
in the rainy season have a depth of from two to four feet, becoming
entirely dry in the southern winter (June, July).</p>

of <i>Lepidosiren paradoxa</i> Fitzinger. (After Kerr.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Kerr on the Habits of Lepidosiren.</b>&mdash;The loalach, as the <i>Lepidosiren</i>
is locally called, is normally sluggish, wriggling slowly
about at the bottom of the swamp, using its hind limbs in
irregular alternation as it clambers through the dense vegetation.
More rapid movement is brought about by lateral
strokes of the large and powerful posterior end of the body.
It burrows with great facility, gliding through the mud, for
which form of movement the shape of the head, with the
upper lip overlapping the lower and the external nostril placed
within the lower lip, is admirably adapted. It feeds on plants,
alg&aelig;, and leaves of flower-plants. The gills are small and quite
unable to supply its respiratory needs, and the animal must
rise to the surface at intervals, like a frog. It breathes with
its lungs as continuously and rhythmically as a mammal, the
air being inhaled through the mouth. The animal makes no
vocal sound, the older observation that it utters a cry like
that of a cat being doubtless erroneous. Its strongest sense is
that of smell. In darkness it grows paler in color, the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
chromatophores shrinking in absence of light and enlarging in
the sunshine. In injured animals this reaction becomes much
less, as they remain pale even in daylight.</p>

</div>

<p>In the rainy season when food is abundant the Lepidosiren
eats voraciously and stores great quantities of orange-colored
fat in the tissues between the muscles. In the dry season it
ceases to feed, or, as the Indians put it, it feeds on water. When
the water disappears the Lepidosiren burrows down into the
mud, closing its gill-openings, but breathing through the mouth.
As the mud stiffens it retreats to the lower part of its burrow,
where it lies with its tail folded over its face, the body surrounded
by a mucous secretion. In its burrow there remains
an opening which is closed by a lid of mud. At the end of the
dry season this lid is pushed aside, and the animal comes out
when the water is deep enough. When the waters rise the
presence of Lepidosirens can be found only by a faint quivering
movement of the grass in the bottom of the swamp. When
taken the body is found to be as slippery as an eel and as muscular.
The eggs are laid in underground burrows in the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
peat. Their galleries run horizontally and are usually two feet
long by eight inches wide. After the eggs are laid the male
remains curled up in the nest with them. In the spawning
season an elaborate brush is developed in connection with the
ventral fins.</p>

<p><i>Protopterus</i>, a second genus, is found in the rivers of Africa,
where three species, <i>P. annectens</i>, <i>P. dolloi</i>, and <i>P. &aelig;thiopicus</i>,
are now known.</p>

<p>The genus has five gill-clefts, instead of four as in <i>Lepidosiren</i>.
It retains its external gills rather longer than the latter, and
its limbs are better developed. The habits of <i>Protopterus</i> are
essentially like those of <i>Lepidosiren</i>, and the two types have
developed along parallel lines doubtless from a common ancestry.
No fossil <i>Lepidosirenid&aelig;</i> are known.</p>

</div>

<p>Just as the last page of this volume passes through the
press, there has appeared a bold and striking memoir on the
"Phylogeny of the Teleostomi," by Mr. C. Tate Regan of the
British Museum of Natural History. In this paper Mr. Regan
takes the view that the Chondrostean Ganoids (<i>Pal&aelig;oniscum</i>,
<i>Chondrosteus</i>, <i>Polyodon</i>, <i>Psephurus</i>, etc.) are the most primitive
of the Teleostomous fishes; that the <i>Crossopterygii</i>, the
<i>Dipneusti</i>, the <i>Placodermi</i>, and the <i>Teleostei</i> (as well as the
higher vertebrates) are descended from these; that the <i>Coccosteid&aelig;</i>
(Arthrodires) are the most generalized of the Placoderms,
the <i>Osteostraci</i> and most of the other forms called Ostracophores
(<i>Antiarcha</i>, <i>Anaspida</i>) being allied to the Arthrodires,
and to be included with them among the <i>Placodermi</i>; that
the cephalic appendage of <i>Pterichthyodes</i>, etc., is really a pectoral
fin; that the <i>Heterostraci</i> (<i>Lanarkia</i>, <i>Pteraspis</i>, etc.) are not
Ostracophores or Placoderms at all, but mailed primitive sharks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
derived from the early sharks as the Chim&aelig;ras are, and that the
Holostean Ganoids (<i>Lepisosteus</i>, <i>Amia</i>, etc.) should be separated
from the <i>Chondrostei</i> and referred to the <i>Teleostei</i>, of
which they are the primitive representatives.</p>

<p>Mr. Regan especially calls attention to the very close
similarity in structure of pectoral and ventral fins in the Chondrostean
Ganoids, <i>Psephurus</i> and <i>Polyodon</i>, with that of the
anal fin in the same fishes. From this he derives additional
evidence in favor of the origin of paired fins from a lateral fold.
In his view, the <i>Chondrostei</i> have sprung directly, through
ancestors of the <i>Lysopteri</i> and <i>Selachostomi</i>, from pleuropterygian
sharks (<i>Cladoselache</i>) of the Lower Silurian, and the true
fishes on the one hand and the Crossopterygian-Dipneustan-Placoderm
series on the other are descended from these. The
absence of the lower jaw in fossil remains of Ostracophores
may be due to its cartilaginous structure. "There is no justification
for regarding the <i>Crossopterygii</i> as less specialized
than the <i>Chondrostei</i> because they were the earlier dominant
group."</p>

<p>These views are very suggestive and contain at least some
elements of taxonomic advance, although few naturalists of
to-day will regard the Chondrostean Ganoids as more primitive
than the fishes called <i>Crossopterygii</i> and <i>Placoderms</i>.</p>

<p>These conclusions are summarized by Mr. Regan as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) The <i>Chondrostei</i> are the most generalized <i>Teleostomi</i>.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>Crossopterygii</i> differ from them</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) in the lobate pectoral fin;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) in the larger paired gular plates.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(3) The <i>Placodermi</i> (<i>Coccosteid&aelig;</i>, <i>Asterolepid&aelig;</i>, <i>Cephalaspid&aelig;</i>)
are a natural group, not related to the <i>Heterostraci</i>,
which are <i>Chondropterygii</i>. They may probably
be regarded as armored <i>primitive Crossopterygii</i>, this
view being most in accordance with</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) the arrangement of the cranial roof-bones in <i>Coccosteus</i>;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) the structure of the ventral fin in <i>Coccosteus</i>;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) the structure of the pectoral limb of the <i>Asterolepid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(4) The <i>Dipneusti</i> probably originated from more specialized
<i>Crossopterygii</i>, e.g., from the neighborhood of the
<i>Holoptychiid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>(5) The Teleostei differ in so many respects from the <i>Chondrostei</i>
that they should rank as an order, in which
the <i>Holostei</i> are included.</p></div>

M&uuml;ller in 1845. But the latter term was first taken by Leuckart in 1821 as
a name for Amphibians before any of the living <i>Dipneusti</i> were known. We
therefore follow Boulenger in the use of the name <i>Dipneusti</i>, suggested by
H&aelig;ckel in 1866. The name Dipnoan may, however, be retained as a vernacular

from the earliest stage they assume outwardly the archipterygial form; the
retarded development of the limbs seems curiously amphibian-like; the pectorals
do not properly appear until about the third week, the ventrals not
until after the tenth.</p></div></div>

finer examples of fern photography have ever been produced.</b> Dr.
Waters brings to his work fifteen years of experience in field and herbarium
study, and the book may be expected to prove of permanent scientific value,
as well as to satisfy a want which existing treatises have but imperfectly
filled."&mdash;<i>Plant World.</i></p>
